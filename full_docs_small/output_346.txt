"Yahoo Products Yahoo Mail Abuse and SpamDifference between hostname & domain name?Follow 7 answersAnswersRelevanceRatingNewestOldestBest Answer: Hostnames are used by various naming systems, NIS, DNS, SMB, etc., and so the meaning of the word hostname will vary depending on naming system in question, which in turn varies by type of network. A hostname meaningful to a Microsoft NetBIOS workgroup may be an invalid Internet hostname. When presented with a hostname and no context, it is usually safe to assume that the network is the Internet and DNS is the hostname's naming system. Host names are typically used in an administrative capacity and may appear in computer browser lists, active directory lists, IP address to hostname resolutions, email headers, etc. They are human-readable nick-names, which ultimately correspond to unique network hardware MAC addresses. In some cases the host name may contain embedded domain names and/or locations, non-dotted IP addresses, etc. On a simple local area network, a hostname is usually a single word: for instance, an organization's CVS server might be named ""cvs"" or ""server-1"".   Internet hostnames On the Internet, a hostname is a domain name assigned to the host. This is usually a combination of the host's local name with its parent domain's name. For example, ""en.wikipedia.org"" consists of a hostname (""en"") and the domain name ""wikipedia.org"". This kind of hostname is translated into an IP address via the local hosts file, or the Domain Name System (DNS) resolver. It is possible for a single host to have several hostnames; but generally the operating system of the host prefers to have one hostname that the host uses for itself. Any domain name can also be hostname, as long as the restrictions mentioned below are followed. So, for example, both ""en.wikimedia.org"" and ""wikimedia.org"" are hostnames because they both have IP addresses assigned to them. The domain name ""pmtpa.wikimedia.org"" is not a hostname since it does not have an IP address, but ""rr.pmtpa.wikimedia.org"" is a hostname. All hostnames are domain names, but not all domain names are hostnames.Source (s):http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HostnameIndiana Frenchman · 1 decade ago1 0 CommentHostname Vs Domain NameSource (s):https://shrinke.im/a8CYq? · 1 year ago0 0 CommentFor the best answers, search on this site https://shorturl.im/axUMs hostname In the Internet suite of protocols, the name that is given to a machine.

RE: Difference between hostname & domain name?Source (s):difference hostname domain name: https://biturl.im/vfOBaShaniqua · 3 years ago0 0 CommentA hostname (occasionally also, a sitename) is the unique name by which a network-attached device (which could consist of a computer, file server, network storage device, fax machine, copier, cable modem, etc.) is known on a network. The hostname is used to identify a particular host in various forms of electronic communication such as the World Wide Web, e-mail or Usenet. A domain name is a Web address, such as coolexample.com, that is linked to an IP address (which represents a physical point on the Internet). When someone types a domain name into a Web browser, the requested Web page displays. A domain name consists of a top-level and a second-level domain. A top-level domain (TLD) is the part of the domain name located to the right of the dot (coolexample.com). The most common top-level domains are .com, .net, and .org. Some other popular top-level domains are .biz, .info, .name, and .ws. These common top-level domains have certain guidelines but are, for the most part, available to any registrant, anywhere in the world. There are also restricted top-level domains (rTLDs), like .aero, .biz, .edu, .mil, .museum, .name, and .pro, these require the registrant to represent a certain type of entity or to belong to a certain community. For example, the .name TLD is reserved for individuals, while .edu is reserved for educational entities. Country-code TLDs (ccTLDs) are for Web sites and registrants of a particular geographic location, such as .bz (Belize), .ca (Canada), .dk (Denmark), .ec (Ecuador), .ie (Republic of Ireland), .uk (United Kingdom), .us (United States), and .zw (Zimbabwe). The part of the domain name located to the left of the dot (coolexample.com) — ""yourpersonaldomain,"" in this case — is called the second-level domain (SLD) name. The second-level domain name is the ""readable"" part of the address and refers to the organization or entity behind the Internet address. Second-level domain names must be unique on the Internet and registered with an Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)-accredited registrar. Hope you got it!
