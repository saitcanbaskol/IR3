Are there any recievers that take this into account and protect devices connected to them or would I need something inline? Unless the receiver was struct directly by lightning, I can't see how an outside surge would be caused by the HDMI line. However, any line coming from outside of the house, which includes power, coax, telephone, cable, internet, satellite could produce a surge. This surge could then cause a power surge within the receiver or projector, then knocking out the HDMI board and the device. It is also possible that while knocking out the HDMI board, the surge traveled the HDMI cable. If that did happen, I would expect to see some discoloration on or near the HDMI connector. Even if the surge traveled the HDMI line, that's still a secondary event. More likely is that both devices took separate surges from the same event. In either case you would be better off making sure *every* outside line was surge protected since that would mitigate the source of the problem rather than a secondary effect. That's also one of the reasons that there aren't many HDMI surge protectors (or a component video surge protectors or a coax digital audio surge protectors) - that's not where the primary problem is. It's the lines from from outside that cause the problem. However, if you really want an HDMI surge protector, a simple Google search found this: http://www.firefold.com/%2FFREE-SHIP...SA-P30864.aspx I have no idea what this will do to a normal high speed HDMI signal. So, buyer beware and I'd make sure that this device isn't going to degrade the high speed signal before purchasing. Also, even if you purchase and install this device, I would still expect that at least one of the HDMI boards would fry if the exact same event happened again. Finally, not all surge protectors are created equal. Make sure you look at the ratings of each to find out how much energy the surge protector can dissipate.alk3997 is offline Quotepost #3 of 35Old 04-28-2011, 09:01 AM - Thread StarterrkleinMemberJoin Date: Jun 2007Posts: 80Mentioned: 0 Post (s)Tagged: 0 Thread (s)Quoted: 0 Post (s)Liked: 10Since both devices were on surge protectors, perhaps the surge protector doesn't provide enough protection for presumably more sensitive HDMIrklein is offline Quotepost #4 of 35Old 04-28-2011, 02:27 PMColmAVS Forum Special MemberJoin Date: Aug 2002Posts: 4,649Mentioned: 0 Post (s)Tagged: 0 Thread (s)Quoted: 1 Post (s)Liked: 94Quote:Originally Posted by rklein ...would I need something inline? Best approach is to keep surges out of the building with a whole-house approach that protects all potential surge paths including AC, cable, etc. Receivers don't do surge protection. Surge protection of an HDMI connection is problematic. The devices to do it add a small but finite capacitance to each line protected. The problem is that even a small additional capacitance may be enough to upset the signal enough that it is unusable. The page describing the device Andy mentioned says that it is ""active on all...TMDS channels"" and doesn't mention the other lines. Only way to find out if it screws up your picture is to try it. But if it doesn't protect all the lines, it is worthless IMHO. You may or may not see any visible indication of the surge on the equipment. If all the paths were protected, and the devices connected by the HDMI cable are on separate MOV-based surge protective devices plugged into different receptacles, it may be that is the cause of the damage. There can be a considerable difference in ground potential between receptacles when a surge is shunted to ground.Colm is offline Quotepost #5 of 35Old 04-30-2011, 06:25 AMBrent McCallAdvanced MemberJoin Date: Jul 2000Location: Ormond Beach Fl.Posts: 657Mentioned: 0 Post (s)Tagged: 0 Thread (s)Quoted: 0 Post (s)Liked: 10When looking at HDMI surge issues, you need to look from a slightly different angle.

I am an electronics engineer and deal with surge, ground loops and many other problems on industrial communications. I currently live in Singapore on a landed property. At tropics you live with lightning and thunder that's it. But this is not my first experience before Singapore I was living in England suburban area in a house, similar problems when there is lightning. I think i have blown 5 phone modems in my life but that is all lightning could do to me until recently. Now bit technical I am personally anal with the ground, earth and Neutral lines. There is a surge protection on the mains on the distribution board. In my set up above all the devices are connect to the mains from a single point. (read it as single socket if you like) This Socket has a Direct Earth, Direct Neutral, Direct Live wire from the switch board. All the power is distributed from a single distribution socket. Yes, I do bet it is a MOV device. However there is no separate Natural or Earth reference for different devices. Lightning; My house did not get hit by lightning, but some where near by did. Any device that is connected on HDMI, the device HDMI port is gone (blown, burnt) all the devices are working with other input out put ports. EXCLUDING Sony PS3! Any device that is connected but NOT via HDMI is working. Hence it does look like HDMI port is very susceptible to surges, much more than other connections we have. After reading more about this I have found recommendations to manufacturers implementing HDMI standards for surge protection. Sadly this is NOT compulsory, so every manufacturer is saving a 50c per device by not putting these in... If i can find a way to put optical isolation between my devices i would do this... copper does have its weaknesses.

At least you would only lose one side of the connection. But, as you said the lightning didn't strike your house and it didn't sound like inductance reached your house. So, how did the surge reach your equipment? Not knowing your setup, it seems to me that it would have to be an attached cable, whether that is power or coax. I've noticed in the U.S. many (most) of these issues are with cable customers. Is there any chance that the surges are coming in your cable and then out the cable box's HDMI line?

Fortunately, I'm a technician with 45 years experience, so I'm able to replace the HDMI interface chip in the TV again. This time it also took out the HDMI port on my DISH receiver. I've also lost several HDMI switches. NOTHING is getting to my equipment by way of the power line! I have a whole-house arrester on the pole, below the meter, then a Tripp Lite outlet box that boasts $50,000 guarantee for connected equipment, then a Topaz sine-wave UPS, then another Tripp Lite, then another outlet strip with surge suppression. But here's the deal. A very close lightning strike produces an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that will induce thousands or even tens of thousands of volts into ANY nearby length of wire. In addition to HDMI ports, I've also lost the PS2 port on a computer motherboard, along with the connected KVM switch, several ethernet ports, and an expensive video server. So, what can be done? You can start by using the shortest possible cables. Monoprice has HDMI cables as short as one and a half feet, and they have ferrite cores at each end (which may not help, but can't hurt). Second, you can use a sacrificial device, such as an HDMI switch or an extender/booster. Let the circuitry in these cheap (less than $20) devices take the hit. With luck, they won't pass the spike through to your expensive equipment. I'm not sure whether the power available on HDMI will handle multiple devices, but I'm going to give it a try and will post my results here. As for the surge protection built into HDMI ports, yes, these chips do have it, but the problem is not just volts, but energy. That's volts X amps X time. The chips will protect against fairly high voltage, but not many amps, or not many microseconds. That's fine for static discharge, but lighting induced surges involve a LOT of energy, that can overwhelm the protection that can be built into a chip. MOV's that are used in outlet strips can handle it, but they have lots of capacitance, and cannot be used with high-frequency signal lines, as that capacitance will act as a short circuit to those frequencies. As for the available HDMI surge supressors, as yet the price is just too high for me.whinnycritter is offline Quotepost #20 of 35Old 06-26-2014, 05:33 PMfashbyNewbieJoin Date: Jun 2014Posts: 1Mentioned: 0 Post (s)Tagged: 0 Thread (s)Quoted: 0 Post (s)Liked: 0Problems with Lightning and HDMIHello, I have experienced the same issues with lightning and HDMI. My house is well grounded and I have a whole house surge protector. I have a 50' HDMI cable running through my attic. A nearby lightning strike can produce a huge magnetic field around the house to the point of producing noticeable static voltages. (I say this from experience because my wife said she felt a static shock in her finger after the last nearby lightning strike.) I have had 2 separate incidences of HDMI ports getting fried after a nearby lightning strike - A mother board HDMI port, 2 TV HDMI ports, an Xbox that completely died even though the power supply was fine and an HDMI splitter. All this with no other noticeable damage. My guess is that the house surge protector is doing it's job but the long HDMI cable is picking up enough voltage to fry my equipment. It is also possible that the telephone cables in the attic are bringing in spikes that are being transferred to the HDMI cable. I suspect EM spikes are causing the problem so I am going to try HDMI surge protectors - wish me luck!fashby is offline Quotepost #21 of 35Old 06-26-2014, 10:05 PMwhinnycritterNewbieJoin Date: Jul 2013Posts: 2Mentioned: 0 Post (s)Tagged: 0 Thread (s)Quoted: 1 Post (s)Liked: 10DIY HDMI Surge ProtectionI recently broke down and purchased an HDMI Surge Protector. First thing I did was open it up. For all the money it cost, it was disappointing to see how little was in there. No active components, just about 10 or so tiny MOV's (metal oxide varistors), each smaller than the head of a pin. Total part cost, including the small metal box and connectors, is less than $10. The printed circuit board traces also had zig-zag sections, which is a common method of creating very low value inductors. Considering the very high frequencies involved with HDMI video, this is really about all you can get away with, without degrading the signal. Larger MOV's have far too much capacitance. These are a few picofarads, at most. But it should work as promised, providing that the energy in a surge doesn't exceed the rating of the MOV's. But the bad news is that MOV's this size can't handle much energy. A long cable could pick up enough energy to destroy them. But the failure mode would be to become a short circuit, so it should still protect connected equipment, but the surge protector itself would then have to be replaced (~$150). Sooooo, I've bought some suitable MOV's, much smaller than the head of a pin, and when I get a chance I'll build my own HDMI surge protectors. I'll start by picking up some similar sized HDMI signal boosters, and use the metal boxes and connectors. Then I'll have some pc boards made, and since the boards are very small, I can get a panel of a dozen or so boards for the cost of just one. I'm fortunate to have the skill and equipment to do the surface mount soldering. I will also include fuses, in the form of short pieces of extremely fine magnet wire, which hopefully will blow before the MOV's are damaged, but that may be wishful thinking. If it does work as hoped, a blown device could be repaired in minutes at no cost. Meanwhile, I'd consider using a wireless link to replace a long cable. Chances are that lightning will not damage the link, and your expensive connected equipment should be quite safe.whinnycritter is offline Quotepost #22 of 35Old 07-06-2015, 08:27 PMPSimpsoNewbieJoin Date: Feb 2013Posts: 6Mentioned: 0 Post (s)Tagged: 0 Thread (s)Quoted: 1 Post (s)Liked: 10I'm following up with this thread to see if there have been any developments.

The first time I tried it out, one of the two HDMI ports wasn't working (no idea what happened, the seller claims he had been using both). Now I'm left with one working HDMI port and the fear that I'll lose it if I'm not careful. Also, this being a ~$300 used TV, I can't justify spending a lot of money. Are there any relatively inexpensive measures I should be taking? Maybe a cheaper HDMI surge protector? A heftier surge protecting power strip? An inexpensive UPS? A shorter HDMI cable?

I've just purchased surge suppressors for both of the coax connections and was thinking about a whole house surge protector, but after Fashby's post, I'm not sure what else to do. Both coax lines were previously grounded and fed through the Belkin surge protector. Are there surge protectors (better quality) that will help? Do whole house surge protectors typically help? In searching the forums, it sounds like AC and coax are pathways that surges and/or lightning strikes can get into equipment blow the fragile HDMI ports. I know that after the fact, people can call upon manufacturer's warranties, credit card warranties, surge protector warranties, insurance companies, and even claims with their electrical service providers, but I really want to prevent future issues.

I have had homes where two out of the 4 TV's lost their HDMI boards and the one room lost the HDMI board for the receiver. The Bluray player was not harmed. Again all homes were on a cable system not satellite. I am now considering using HDMI surge suppressors on the cable box output. I have found some that are 4K but none that are 4K and 2.0.rdmitchell is offline Quotepost #25 of 35Old 08-17-2015, 04:56 PMJosh87NewbieJoin Date: Jul 2015Posts: 4Mentioned: 0 Post (s)Tagged: 0 Thread (s)Quoted: 3 Post (s)Liked: 0Quote:Originally Posted by rdmitchellHello, I am an A/V professional and I have seen enough HDMI surge problems to at least get a handle on what is going on. Everyone of my customers that have had equipment broken because of HDMI surge issues is due to a surge coming over the RG6 cable to the cable box and then out over the HDMI. When this has happened it can be as bad as every HDMI board in the system is broken including the cable box. Or it can be as ""painless"" as the customer I had today who only lost the HDMI wire (crazy, first time for that, 45' directional wire) and the one output of his new Marantz amp.

Thanks rdmitchell, but I don't think HDMI surge suppressors are the fix. From what I now understand and have researched, the problem is that surges/interference travel through the power lines, coax lines, and Ethernet cables connected to your TV, so protecting the HDMI cables with their own surge protector is too late. I'm doing the following:Installing a whole house surge protectorContinuing to use surge protectors at the outlet for expensive devicesPutting surge protectors (inline with gas) on my coax linesBuying another Type A board from ShopJimmy.com in case my HDMI ports get blown againI was able to fix my TV for $120 with a Type A board from ShopJimmy.com in a little over an hour. You just have to be gentle with the ribbon connectors. I might also consider a zero surge device.

If you are in an area that has a high propensity for lightening strikes and power outages, the only way to really protect your devices is with whole house surge protection. Then put your important devices on a secondary system such as an APC battery backup or whatever. Current will follow what ever path it can to ground and that includes coax, phone line, RG-6, HDMI, etc.Otto Pylot is online now Quotepost #27 of 35Old 08-17-2015, 08:41 PMrdmitchellNewbieJoin Date: Aug 2015Posts: 2Mentioned: 0 Post (s)Tagged: 0 Thread (s)Quoted: 1 Post (s)Liked: 0All of the equipment was on surge suppressors. The RG6 cable was run through a properly grounded ground block in all cases. I think in most of the cases the surge would have never tripped the surge suppressor because the cable boxes survived but the sensitive HDMI boards did not. However, from now on all customers are getting gas block suppressors on cable and an hdmi suppressor out of the cable box.rdmitchell is offline Quotepost #28 of 35Old 08-17-2015, 09:39 PMOtto PylotAVS Forum Addicted MemberJoin Date: May 2004Location: Bull Mountain, ORPosts: 11,860Mentioned: 8 Post (s)Tagged: 1 Thread (s)Quoted: 1848 Post (s)Liked: 1158By gas block suppressors do you mean gas discharge tubes?

We switched to cable in the spring to save a few bucks (broadband + TV bundle.) In the last four weeks we've lost two HDMI ports on one TV and one on the other. No changes to the house wiring. Satellite was three horns into three to-house connections + broadband; cable is one into four. Grounding of the incoming cabled coax looks OK. The HDMIs smoked during particularly violent t-storms, semi-simultaneous flash-bang, hits less than 1,000 ft. away. The Samsung DVR and Cisco set-top box were not damaged (nor was the cable modem). The non-HDMI TV electronics are OK. We had many, many t-storms while using satellite. Occam's Razor says cable is the culprit. I would think that if it was EMP into the six-foot HDMI cables we would have seen this when on satellite. So back to satellite; I can't afford two new TVs every six months.doctor.dude is offline Quote"
