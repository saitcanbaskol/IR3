"Receptor Tyrosine KinasesRegulatory molecules that stimulate cell proliferation are known  as growth factors. Certain growth factors also guide the  differentiation of cells into specialized cell types. Many growth  factors signal via a signal transduction pathway involving receptor               tyrosine kinases. Notable examples are:Vascular-endothelial growth factor  ( VEGF) This  growth factor promotes new blood vessel growth, but is also  important for maintenance of endothelial cells in the delicate  filtration membrane of the kidney.Neurotrophins Neurotrophins promote the survival and  differentiation of neurons.Insulin-like growth factor-1  ( IGF-1) This  hormone/paracrine is produced in response to growth hormone, and  is responsible for the majority of its growth-promoting effects.The steps involved in signaling are diagrammed in the figure  below. The first step is that ligand binding causes receptor  dimerization: that is, binding of the ligand brings together  two receptors. The receptors, which are tyrosine kinases, can now  phosphorylate each other ( receptor autophosphorylation ).  The phosphotyrosine on the phosphorylated receptor is a  binding site for an adaptor protein that also binds a guanine-nucleotide exchange           factor  ( GEF protein ).Binding to the phosphorylated receptor recruits these proteins to  the membrane. The GEF protein activates Ras, a small monomeric G-binding           protein by exchanging GTP for GDP (GTP replaces GDP). Ras is  one member of a large family of small monomeric G-proteins.  G-proteins act as molecular switches: they are activated when they  bind GTP. Ras controls cell proliferation, but other monomeric  G-proteins are involved in regulating cell shape changes through  effects on the cytoskeleton, or involved in membrane trafficking  through exocytosis and endocytosis.Activated Ras turns on the first in a cascade of protein kinases,  where each protein kinase phosphorylates and activates another  protein kinase. The ultimate result is the phosphorylation of  transcription factors that enter the nucleus and alter gene  expression, turning on genes involved in growth and cellular  differentiation.Ras is inactivated when GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. Like the alpha  subunit of a trimeric G-protein, monomeric G-proteins like Ras are  GTPases. However, the rate of GTPase activity of Ras is greatly  increased by another protein, the GTPase activating protein or GAP protein  (blue-green in figure).Unregulated growth results if there is alteration or  over-expression of proteins in this pathway. Mutant genes for  proteins in these growth regulatory pathways are called oncogenes ,  since their abnormal proteins convert normal cells into cancer  cells. The term proto-oncogene is used to refer to the  normal, unmutated form of the gene. Mutations that activate Ras  are present in about a third of all human tumors. One type of  cancer-causing mutation results from a defect in the GTPase  activity of Ras.Quick QuizFill in Answer Correct False Correct Answer1.
