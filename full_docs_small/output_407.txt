(reactant or product) reactantHow is CO2 involved in cellular respiration? (reactant or product) productHow is O2 involved in photosynthesis? (reactant or product) productHow is O2 involved in cellular respiration? (reactant or product) reactantWhat are the products in photosynthesis? 6O2 + C6H12O6What are the products in cellular respiration? 6H2O + ^CO2 + ATPWhen does photosynthesis occur? when there is lightWhen does cellular respiration occur? oxygen is present, all the time (cells always need energy)Autotrophs or Heterotrophs (Photosynthesis) AutotrophsAutotrophs or Heterotrophs (Cellular Respiration) BothWhere does Glycolysis occur? in the cytoplasmWhere does krebs cycle occur? matrixWhere does ETC occur? cristaePurpose of Glycolysis? produce ATPPurpose of Krebs cycle? generate more energy, whic his released, pyruvic acid --> CO2Purpose of ETC? transport electrons, produce lots of ATPReactants of Glycolysis? 2 ATP to get reaction started NAD+ glucoseReactants of Krebs cycle? pyruvic acidReactants of ETC? ATP, NADH, FADH2Products of Glycolysis? pyruvic acid, NADH, ATPProducts of Krebs cycle? ATP, NADH, FADH2Products of ETC? ATp (energy), H2OWhere does Photosynthesis? chloroplastWhere does Cellular Respiration occur? mitochondriaWhere does Fermentation occur? cytoplasmPurpose of Photosynthesis? to capture sunlight, water and carbon dioxide, then produce oxygen and sugarPurpose of Cellular Respiration? releases energy in food in the presence of oxygenPurpose of Fermentation? releases energy in food when oxygen is not presentReactants of Photosynthesis? 6H2O + 6CO2Reactants of Cellular Respiration? 6O2 + C6H12O6Reactants of Fermentation? pyruvic acid + NADHProducts of Photosynthesis? 6CO2 + C6H12O6Products of Cellular Respiration? 6H2O + 6CO2Products of Fermentation? alcohol- CO2 + 2ATP lactic acid- NAD+ + 2ATPAdvertisement Upgrade to remove adsFeaturesQuizlet LiveQuizlet LearnDiagramsFlashcardsMobileHelpSign upHelp CenterHonor CodeCommunity GuidelinesStudentsTeachersAboutCompanyPressJobsPrivacyTermsFollow us LanguageÂ© 2018 Quizlet Inc."
