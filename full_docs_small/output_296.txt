"Acid-Alkaline Dairy and Egg Products Food ChartSpread the loveI explain the values for this acid-alkaline dairy and egg food chart in my Basic Acid Alkaline Food Chart Introduction.Iâ€™ve used these acid-alkaline foods charts to introduce this food diary project, which will soon have many more features and benefits. I will provide you with your, personal online food diary. These charts are basic, but the finished project will be rich with many features that allow you to manage your diet. I have many ideas for turning this basic information into an interactive service to help you plan your diet, but I also want your ideas. Your feedback will help me build this project quickly to provide you with better nutrition management tools.If you have any questions about this information or have any suggestions for improvements,
