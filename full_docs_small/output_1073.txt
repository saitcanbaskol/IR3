"Get Space for Everyone in the 2016 SedonaBy blogsadmin | Posted in Kia Sedona on Friday, August 14th, 2015 at 2:22 pmHow many passengers can fit in the 2016 Kia Sedona?We are guessing a few years ago, when you purchased that sporty little coupe or sedan, that you never thought that just a couple years later you would be looking for a new minivan. But, trust us, we understand that it happens. Few more kids come along, you’re volunteering for carpools, and all that extra space is necessary. But just how many kids can you bring along for the ride. We answer the question, how many passengers can fit in the 2016 Kia Sedona?The 2016 Kia Sedona has plenty of seating options available across its five different trims. The vehicle has 7- or 8-passenger configurations. In the past, the 8 passenger seating was only available in the L, LX, and EX trims. Now, thanks to a new addition with the Technology Package, the SX and SX-Limited trims of the 2016 Sedona can have the 8-passenger seating option as well.As you can most likely guess at this point, that means that the 2016 Kia Sedona trims that have 7-passenger seating are the SX and SX-L trims. Each Sedona trim offers 50/50 split-folding third-row seats. It is in the second row where customers have the most options. They can either choose to have captains’ chairs or a 3-passenger 2nd-row with a fold down center console.The vehicle also has one of the most popular comfort features on the market today available with its SX-Limited trim. That would be the First-Class Lounge Seating in the second row. This provides two captain’s chairs that recline and have lower leg support. That is right, this is like having your comfy recliner in the 2nd row!There are plenty of other great comfort features in the 2016 Sedona available. These options include great features like heated and ventilated seats, an 8-way power driver’s seat, premium Nappa leather seat trim, and much more.Prospective minivan van customers wondering how many passengers can fit in the 2016 Kia Sedona should contact a Carolina Kia sales professional by calling 888-980-9494.Facebook Twitter Google+ PinterestMore from Carolina Kia...Get to Know the Specs & Features of the 2018 Kia SedonaWhat Kia Cars are Good for Families?How different is the 2017 Kia Sedona from the 2016 Sedona?What are the Best Family Vehicles of 2016?< Previous post Next post >"
