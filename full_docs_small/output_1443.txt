"Pets DogsWhen do female dogs go into heat?What are the breeding seasons for dogs? How often and when do female dogs bleed? Is there like a tampon for female dogs when they bleed? I donot have a dog. Im was just curious so please answerFollow 16 answersAnswersRelevanceRatingNewestOldestBest Answer: There is no set breeding season, each individual dog has her own cycle and comes into heat at based on that cycle. Dogs have three heats every two years, each heat lasts about a week, they only bleed during heat and the amount of blood varies by dog. Some have so little blood the owners might not notice she is in heat, others have so much that owners sometimes take them to the vet thinking she is injured. Not tampons, tampons wouldn't stay in even if you could get the dog to hold still while you put it in. Most people either use diapers or follow the dog around cleaning up after her.cnw002 · 10 years ago0 1 CommentThere are no exact seasons for breeding. Females go into heat every 6-8 mos. Responsible breeders do every other heat, starting from age 2 up to age 4 or 5. No tampons for dogs. They have doggie diapers, IF the dog doesn't tear them off. It's best just to spay and not help add to the problem of dog overpopulation.Sammy Gabbie MY POOS! · 10 years ago0 0 CommentA female's first heat is usually at 4-6 months of age, and later for larger dogs. It's lasts about 21 days, and they bleed I believe for the first seven. A female's heat comes around every 6 months And No, there aren't tampons, there are diapers.Dog is my co-pilot · 10 years ago0 0 CommentFemales go into heat about 6 months of age and will have a cycle every 6 months. There is no such thing as a tampon for dog use however there are diaper pants that you can use with pads inside them. If the dog is going to be bred, it is best to wait until after the third cycle or when the dog is about 2 years of age.Staffie1 · 10 years ago0 0 Commentthere is no set season for dogs to come into heat, they have the first between 6 and 12 months, then every 6 months after that. There are NO tampons for a dog in heat.They bleed every time they are in heatchihuahualady264 · 10 years ago0 0 CommentFor the best answers, search on this site https://shorturl.im/kgMEL Yes. Unless you see other symptoms, she's probably in heat. She should only bleed for 7-10 days (although actual cycle lasts around 21 days) Keep her away from intact males whilst she is in heat. If the actual bleeding goes on any longer than 10 days, if there seems to be too much blood, or if she shows symptoms not associated with the heat cycle - google will tell you symptoms - then see a vet who can check for infections or worse. But don't worry for now... it's normal and will happen approx every six months if she is unspayed.Murielle · 2 years ago0 0 CommentFemale dogs go into ""heat"" starting at six months of age or so. They are in heat for roughly three weeks and heat returns about twice a year. Some clean themselves up so nicely that you don't notice the blood OR they only bleed for a few days. They make diapers that you put on them when in heat, but it's best to give them some time during the day in the crate so they can clean themselves and air out. As far as breeding goes, it's best to NOT breed because most pet dogs are not breeding quality. Responsible breeders breed only to better their particular breed, or to preserve strong bloodlines in a working/Police/Service dog.Source (s):Owned by MuttTruth Hurts, Doesn't It? · 10 years ago1 2 CommentThe season is whenever the females are in heat.
