So say you run the 60m sprint there is just no way you can acieve 10 meters per second for it due to this fact. So just to sum up distance is a major factor when asking for average sprint speed beacuse there is no correct answer. but in my opinion in 100m= 13-14 (male) 14-15 (female) are above averageD S · 1 decade ago0 2 CommentThe highest human footspeed ever recorded is 48 km/h (29.8 mph), seen during a 100 meter sprint by Asafa Powell.

It just depends.loooon · 1 decade ago0 0 CommentI believe the average lies in between 5-7 for reasonably or physically fit men. These times are also only for 40 Yard dash. The lower end of the scale (4 and below) is more for professional athletes, while in between, and the higher time, the slower.dan · 1 decade ago0 3 CommentTrack stars usually hit about 23 - 26 mph and you are pretty fast.Lisa · 2 years ago0 1 Commentfastest ever is probably 20 to 30 miles an hour a three minute mile which is world record is twenty average soo...Christian B · 1 decade ago0 3 Comment12miles per hour..fastest is like...15 miles per hour...im in track and field sooo.. :]LOST-ECHO8P · 1 decade ago0 8 CommentPerhaps you would like to learn more about one of these?Curious About Your Ancestors?
