For example, if you scored an 1300 on one test and a 1500 on another, they won't actually average the two tests.More commonly, the school will take your highest score on a single test date. Even better, some schools form a Superscore - that is, they take your highest section score across all your test dates and combine them.Some students are still worried about submitting too many test scores. They're afraid that Tennessee Technological University will look down on too many attempts to raise your score. But how many is too many?From our research and talking to admissions officers, we've learned that 4-6 tests is a safe number to submit. The college understands that you want to have the best chance of admission, and retaking the test is a good way to do this. Within a reasonable number of tests, they honestly don't care how many times you've taken it. They'll just focus on your score.If you take it more than 6 times, colleges start wondering why you're not improving with each test. They'll question your study skills and ability to improve.But below 6 tests, we strongly encourage retaking the test to maximize your chances. If your SAT score is currently below a 1010, we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the SAT and retaking it. You don't have much to lose, and you can potentially raise your score and significantly boost your chances of getting in.Exclusive: Want to learn how to improve your SAT score by 160 points?Download our free guide on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score.

This score makes Tennessee Technological University Moderately Competitive for ACT scores.The 25th percentile ACT score is 20, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 26.ACT Score Sending PolicyIf you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.Here it is: when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send. You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 20 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.ACT Superscore PolicyBy and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to Tennessee Technological University, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 20.Studying for the ACT instead?

Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.We did not find information that Tennessee Technological University requires SAT subject tests, and so most likely it does not. At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test."
