There are many countries in our blood, aren't there, but only one person. Would the world be in the mess it is if we were loyal to love and not to countries?” ― Graham Greene , Our Man in Havanatags: countries , love , loyalty , nationality , politics , war 296 likesLike“Maybe your country is only a place you make up in your own mind. Something you dream about and sing about. Maybe it's not a place on the map at all, but just a story full of people you meet and places you visit, full of books and films you've been to. I'm not afraid of being homesick and having no language to live in. I don't have to be like anyone else. I'm walking on the wall and nobody can stop me.” ― Hugo Hamilton , The Speckled People: A Memoir of a Half-Irish Childhoodtags: anchoring , attachment , belonging , country , empowerment , home , homelessness , independence , individuality , inspirational , nationality , roots , self-assurance , self-awareness , self-containment , self-determination , self-esteem , self-reliance , self-respect , self-sufficiency , self-trust231 likesLike“If my theory of relativity is proven successful, Germany will claim me as a German and France will declare me a citizen of the world. Should my theory prove untrue, France will say that I am a German, and Germany will declare that I am a Jew.” ― Albert Einsteintags: fame , infamy , nationality 228 likesLike“But you know as well as I, patriotism is a word; and one that generally comes to mean either my country, right or wrong, which is infamous, or my country is always right, which is imbecile.” ― Patrick O'Brian , Master and Commandertags: jingoism , maturin , nationalism , nationality , patriotism , stephen-maturin 158 likesLike“But when they made love he was offended by her eyes. They behaved as though they belonged to someone else. Someone watching. Looking out of the window at the sea. At a boat in the river. Or a passerby in the mist in a hat. He was exasperated because he didn't know what that look meant. He put it somewhere between indifference and despair. He didn’t know that in some places, like the country that Rahel came from, various kinds of despair competed for primacy. And that personal despair could never be desperate enough. That something happened when personal turmoil dropped by at the wayside shrine of the vast, violent, circling, driving, ridiculous, insane, unfeasible, public turmoil of a nation. That Big God howled like a hot wind, and demanded obeisance. Then Small God (cozy and contained, private and limited) came away cauterized, laughing numbly at his own temerity. Inured by the confirmation of his own inconsequence, he became resilient and truly indifferent. Nothing mattered much. Nothing much mattered. And the less it mattered, the less it mattered. It was never important enough. Because Worse Things had happened. In the country that she came from, poised forever between the terror of war and the horror of peace, Worse Things kept happening. So Small God laughed a hollow laugh, and skipped away cheerfully. Like a rich boy in shorts. He whistled, kicked stones. The source of his brittle elation was the relative smallness of his misfortune. He climbed into people’s eyes and became an exasperating expression.” ― Arundhati Roy , The God of Small Thingstags: bigness , despair , desperation , exasperation , eyes , indifference , nationality , peace , personal , public , smallness , war120 likesLike“Tír gan teanga, tír gan anam.

Its caravans, those strange rambling feasts and cultures, left nothing behind, not an ember. All of us, even those with European homes and children in the distance, wished to remove the clothing of our countries. It was a place of faith.

Lying on her back with eyes closed, Desdemona could detect the telltale oniony aroma of a Hungarian woman on her right, and the raw-meat smell of an Armenian on her left. (And they, in turn, could peg Desdemona as a Hellene by her aroma of garlic and yogurt.)” ― Jeffrey Eugenides , Middlesextags: greek , nationality , smell 6 likesLike“To become truly human,one has to try an release oneself from the shackles of race,religion and nationality.The quantum of humanism one acquires is inevitably filtered when one limits oneself.""-Ashoka Jahnavi Prasad (Kant Lecture,20090)” ― Ashoka Jahnavi Prasadtags: humanity , nationality , race , religion 6 likesLike“If my mother's intention in whole or in part was to ensure that I never had to suffer any indignity or embarrassment for being a Jew, then she succeeded well enough. And in any case there were enough intermarriages and 'conversions' on both sides of her line to make me one of those many mischling hybrids who are to be found distributed all over the known world. And, as someone who doesn't really believe that the human species is subdivided by 'race,' let alone that a nation or nationality can be defined by its religion, why should I not let the whole question slide away from me? Why—and then I'll stop asking rhetorical questions—did I at some point resolve that, in whatever tone of voice I was asked 'Are you a Jew?' I would never hear myself deny it?” ― Christopher Hitchens , Hitch-22: A Memoirtags: antisemitism , intermarriage , jews , mothers , nationality , race , religion , religious-conversions , rhetorical-questions5 likesLike“Sich mit diesem oder jenem zu identifizieren, ist also ein normaler Vorgang. Gefährlich wird es, sobald eine einzige Identität bestimmend wird, sobald man nur noch Muslim ist oder Christ oder Deutscher, Iraner oder meinetwegen Anhänger eines bestimmten Fußballclubs oder eines Popstars. Dann wird aus der pragmatischen Einschränkung, die jede Art von Identifizierung bedeutet, eine reale Verstümmelung der Persönlichkeit.” ― Navid Kermanitags: identity , nationality , religion 3 likesLike“Through love, tribes have been intermixing colors to reveal a new rainbow world.

Nationality exists, and has nothing in the world to do with race. Nationality is a thing like a church or a secret society. It is the product of the human soul and will; it is a spiritual product. And there are men… who would think anything and do anything rather than admit anything could be a spiritual product.” ― G.K. Chestertontags: nationality , race , secret-society , spirituality 3 likesLike“Anders als die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika haben sich die meisten europäischen Nationalstaaten auf der Grundlage von Homogenisierungen entwickelt; historisch liegt ihnen das Ideal einer Einheit von Blut, Kultur, Sprache und Religion zugrunde. Dieser Drang zur Vereinheitlichung war kaum irgendwo stärker als in Deutschland, eben weil es sich erst spät zu einer Nation herausgebildet hat, und das Deutsche niemals ein so natürlicher oder unumstrittener Bezugspunkt war wie England für die Engländer oder Frankreich für die Franzosen.” ― Navid Kermanitags: identity , nationality , patriotism 2 likesLike“He used to be a German, but he completely recovered.” ― Boris Akunin , Sister Pelagia and the White Bulldogtags: nationality 2 likesLike“Але основна заслуга Потебні та, що він теоретично обґрунтував право самостійного розвитку мови і показав перспективи розвитку мов людства. Потебня виходив з того, що мова завжди якнайщільніше зв'язана з мисленням. Він завжди розглядав різні «мови як глибоко відмінні системи засобів мислення». Наприклад, німець уживає при іменнику артикля, дієслово в підрядному реченні ставить в кінець; українець цього не робить. Отже, чи німець мислить як українець, а потім додає артикль і переставляє дієслово? Ясно що ні. Самий перебіг мислення дещо відмінний. Кожний народ мислить по-своєму, і це зумовлено його мовою. Так усі люди бачать те саме, але не зовсім однаково, бо не цілковито тотожний у них устрій ока. Приказки, усталені вирази, сфера вживання кожного слова — все це різне в різних мовах, і все це безпосередньо позначається на мисленні. Отже, своєрідність мови — це своєрідність мислення. Людство тим багатше на надбання думки, чим більше мов воно плекає. Потебня категорично відкидає можливість злиття усіх мов людства в єдину — абсурдна ідея, з якою потім носилися більшовики, приховуючи нею русифікаторську політику. Якби таке злиття сталося, каже Потебня, то це означало б непоправне збіднення людської культури: «Якби об'єднання людства щодо мови й народності було можливе, воно було б загибеллю для загальнолюдської думки, як заміна багатьох почуттів одним, хоч би це єдине було не дотиком, а зором. Для існування людини потрібні інші люди, для народності — інші народності». «Послідовний націоналізм, — каже Потебня в іншому місці, — є інтернаціоналізм».” ― Юрій Шевельов , Дорогою відрадянщення: публіцистичні та наукові тексти 1941-1943 рр.tags: language , nation , nationalism , nationality , potebnja , ukraine , ukrainian 1 likesLike“In peace we play and freedom ring, Now let us enjoy a mantra to sing, Down here we know that today Elated it's a really sunny day, Play: It's Independence Day!

He goes on to say that it was Wilson who persuaded this country that it was patriotic to be stupid, to be proud of knowing only one language, of believing that all other cultures were inferior and ridiculous, offensive to God and common sense alike, that artists and teachers and studious persons in general were ninnies when it came to dealing with problems in life that really mattered, and on and on. This friend says that it was a particular misfortune for this country that the German-Americans had achieved such eminence in the arts and education when it was their turn to be scorned from on high. To hate all they did and stood for at that time, which included gymnastics, by the way, was to lobotomize not only the German-Americans but our culture.
