"Spectator IonsWe also have the potential to have some ions in solution that do not participate in the chemistry. This is because these ions are the conjugate pairs for the strong acids or strong bases. Since those reactions are assumed to go 100% in the forward direction, we can likewise assume they go backwards 0%. This means that those ions will simply remain in solution.What are these ions? Well you can simply look at the lists of strong acids and strong bases and pick the conjugates.For example, the conjugate base for HCl would be Cl -. As such, in aqueous solution the chloride ion is often a spectator ion (when is this not the case, when it is part of a solubility equilibrium. As far as acid/base chemistry it is always a spectator). Other examples include Na +. It is the partner for OH - in the strong base NaOH. Since this dissociates 100%, we can assume it will not react at all with any OH -. Other examples are Nitrate, NO 3-, which is the conjugate base of nitric acid. K +, Ba 2+, ...Look at the list of strong acids and bases for all of them.Concept QuestionWhich of the following will not be a spectator ion in an acid/base reaction?
