"How Hard Deletion of Email Occur in Microsoft Outlook?PST (Personal storage table) is basically a file format that is used to store Outlook data (message, calendar, contacts and other Outlook items). When you delete emails, contacts or some other items from Outlook, these emails are moved to ""Deleted Items Folder"" and this entire process called soft deletion. The soft deleted items of MS-Outlook can be completely recovered or restored by simply dragging or moving those emails from the ""Deleted Items Folder"" to desirable folder.But, when an item is deleted using ""Shift+Delete"", it does not go to the ""Deleted Items Folder"" and this functionality is known as ""Hard Deletion"" and the permanently lost data called hard deleted items of Outlook.How to recover permanently deleted emails from Outlook if you are using Outlook as a Stand-alone mode?There is no way to recover the permanently deleted emails from MS-Outlook if you are using Outlook in stand-alone mode. And the noted myth about ""scanpst.exe"" which ensure that scanpst.exe or Inbox Repair Utility (a free inbuilt of MS-Outlook) also deals with permanently deleted emails of Outlook is totally wrong.There is one scenario or workaround which can somehow help user to recover these kind of ""Shift+Delete""or mistakenly hard deleted items of Outlook, which is the connectivity of Microsoft Outlook with an Exchange server.If you are connected with an exchange server, then there is a medium to revert back all the permanently lost data with the help of ""Dumpster"" features. This feature exists in Exchange, which stores the Outlook data after its hard deletion from Outlook for a limited time period which is known as ""Retention Period"".Is it possible to recover deleted emails from Outlook using Hex Editor and scanpst.exe tool?As it is already discussed in the above paragraphs that ""Scanpst.exe"" or Inbox Repair Utility is a free inbuilt tool provided by Microsoft Outlook.

When they send mails from the new account they keep getting errors from the Exchange Server as it wasn't removed in the change over.

They are not that old, in one particular folder only going back 6 months or so. I have not deleted them and then removed from the deleted Items folder on shutdown of Outlook.
