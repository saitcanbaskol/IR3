"List of Minimum Wage Rates by State 2018The minimum wage, the lowest hourly amount that an employee may be paid for their labor, is determined by both state and Federal labor laws in the United States. Under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, states and localities are permitted to set their own minimum wage rates, which will take precedence over the Federal minimum wage rate if they are higher.In states that do not set a minimum wage rate, or have an antiquated minimum wage rate that is less than the rate set by the Federal government, the Federal minimum wage rate will take precedence and apply to all employees within that state.The table below lists the current prevailing 2018 minimum wage rates for every state in the United States.
