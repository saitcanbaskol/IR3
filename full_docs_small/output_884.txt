"Giant Planets: Hydrogen and HeliumLast: 4. Terrestrial Planets: Rock and Iron Next: 6. Formation of Solar SystemsThe outer Solar System contains two planetary  behemoths and two planets which are merely enormous by our  standards. Jupiter & Saturn have hundreds of times the Earth's  mass; both radiate more energy than they receive from the Sun, and  this outflowing energy powers dramatic activity in their interiors  and atmospheres. Uranus & Neptune, each about 15 times the  Earth's mass, are less active. All have satellite systems and rings  shaped by subtle dynamical effects over trillions of orbits.TopicsGas Giants & Water WorldsInternal StructureSatellite SystemsPlanetary Rings"
