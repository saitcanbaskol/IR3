Diatribes aside, here are the top 10 things you need to know about the mightiest muscle car to ever hit the market.2018 Dodge Demon - 10 Things You Need to Know - 2017 New York Auto ShowYour browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available.

It Makes 840 HorsepowerWith the same supercharged 6.2-liter under the hood as Dodge’s duo of Hellcats, the Demon’s engine has been upgraded to push out 840 horsepower and 770 lb-ft of torque. By comparison, the Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat makes an already-impressive 707 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. The additional output was achieved through the use of a larger supercharger that displaces 2.7-liters. All that power heads to the rear wheels through a beefed-up eight-speed automatic transmission.2. It Runs to 60 mph in 2.3 SecondsDodge says it’ll sprint from a standing start to 60 mph in 2.3 seconds, which is, well, ridiculous. Helping it get there is a handful of drag-specific features like the first-ever transmission brake fitted to a production car. The system works by engaging both forward and reverse gears at the same time to keep the car from creeping while it builds engine speed before launching off the line.3. It Completes the Quarter-Mile in 9.65 SecondsMuch like its run to 60 mph, the car’s quarter-mile time is other-wordly. The Demon’s trap speed is an NHRA-certified 140 mph, which is enough to force the governing body of drag racing to ban the Demon from competition for being too damn fast.4. The Tires are Seriously WideMeasuring more than 12 inches across, the Nitto tires designed specifically for the Dodge Demon are as ideally suited to the drag strip as they are big, smokey burnouts. Also helping on that front is the line-lock, which engages the front brakes to allow the back wheels to spin freely. Intended to build up the tire temperature before a trip down the strip, the line-lock is also perfect for parking lots.5. It Comes With Transition ToolsDubbed the Demon Crate, the box of goodies available with every car is aimed at helping make the transformation from the street to the strip — and back again — just a little bit easier. Included are items like a floor jack, tool bag, impact wrench and torque wrench, among others — all important for getting the car race-ready. It also includes a second set of wheels with the Demon logo displayed prominently on the center caps.6. It’s Lighter Than a HellcatTipping the scales at about 4,300 lb., the Demon weighs roughly 215 lb less than the Challenger Hellcat. It actually shed some 232 lb compared to the Hellcat coupe but gained a bit of it back on its ascent to the top of the muscle car heap. Much of the weight loss is attributed to lighter components like the brakes, suspension and wheels, while the back seat has also been sent to the scrap heap in the name of speed.7. It Can Run on 100+ Octane FuelIf you thought the two keys included with the Hellcat was a cool feature then you’ll love this: The Demon comes with a powertrain control module (PCM) that can be put into the car when it’s time to hit the drag strip. Dropping the new module into the car allows it to run on 100+ octane fuel, while also optimizing the engine to run on the race-specific stuff.8. It Can Get Cold Under the HoodDodge says the Demon will be the first production car to feature a liquid-to-air charge air chiller system that will use the Demon’s air conditioning system to cut the intake air temperature by as much as 45°F.9. The Hood Scoop is HugeHelping keep the engine cool and breathing right is the Demon’s massive hood scoop, which is the biggest you can get on a factory car. It measures 45 inches across, and pushes a ton of air into the engine bay, helping the car make its outrageous output.10. You’ll Have a Hard Time Getting OnePricing hasn’t been announced, but it’s unlikely to cost anything close to the surprisingly affordable Challenger Hellcat. Making matters worse, it’s going to be rare, with production limited to just 3,300 units. The single model year production run will see 3,000 units sold in the U.S., and 300 sold in Canada, where the car is built. It will be available in 14 different colors, including B5 Blue, Billet Silver, Destroyer Grey, F8 Green, Go Mango, Granite Crystal, Indigo Blue, Maximum Steel, Octane Red, Pitch Black, Plum Crazy, TorRed, White Knuckle and Yellow Jacket.Deliveries of the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon are expected to begin in the fall.Filed under: American Auto Show News Breaking News Coupes Dodge Drag Racing FCA Featured Articles Sports Cars Top 10 Videos Tags: 2017 new york auto show, Demon, dodge challenger, Dodge Demon, drag racing, hellcat, muscle cars"
