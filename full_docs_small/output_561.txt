Generally, a harp’s base is attached to the lamp beneath the bulb. The harp’s flexible arms are then connected to the base, completing a rigid loop upon which shades, finials, and other decorative pieces can be mounted.Lamp Harp TypesWe offer both regular and heavy duty harps as well as spare harp bottoms and harps that are intended for use with metal harp cups.
