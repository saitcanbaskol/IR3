Although they share similar movements at the elbow joint, they develop different muscles in the upper arms. Despite their variance, they can be combined in an effective upper arm workout session.Reverse Curls TechniqueThe movements involved in the reverse curl and the French curl are very similar. Both exercises involve flexing of the elbows. To perform reverse biceps curl, hold a pair of dumbbells or a barbell at the front of your upper thighs with your palms facing your legs. Keep your elbows into your torso and bend your elbows up toward your shoulders and then extend your arms to return the weights.French Curls TechniqueFrench curls, which are also commonly known as triceps extension, can be completed while either standing or sitting. If you’re lying down, hold your arms extended up towards the ceiling with palms facing your feet. Bend your elbows to lower the weight towards your forehead and then extend your elbows to return them to starting position. When performing the French curl from a standing position, hold the weights over your head with arms fully extended, and then bend the elbows to drop the weights back behind your head.MusclesWhile both reverse curls and French curls involve flexing of the elbow, the exercises do not target the same muscles. Reverse biceps curls require your elbows to flex, or bend, against the pull of resistance to primarily develop your brachioradialis muscle, with assistance being offered up by the biceps brachii and brachialis muscle. This collection of muscles is located at the front of your upper arms and elbow. The French curls require your elbows to extend against resistance and are therefore a result of work by the triceps brachii muscle located at the back of your upper arms.TrainingWhen part of a single workout, the reverse curl and French curl target all of the major muscle groups in the arms. They can be used to build strength in the brachioradialis, biceps brachii, brachialis and triceps brachii muscle if you perform them at a volume of three to five sets of six or fewer repetitions. They can also be used to build size and tone in your upper arm muscles by performing them at a volume of three to six sets of six to 12 repetitions. Complete them two days per week and allow your upper arm muscles two days of rest in between your workouts.ReferencesExRx.net: Barbell Reverse CurlMuscleHack.com: How To Perform French Curls CorrectlyExRx.net: Barbell Lying Triceps ExtensionAbout the AuthorKim Nunley has been screenwriting and working as an online health and fitness writer since 2005.
