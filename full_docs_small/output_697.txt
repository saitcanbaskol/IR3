Transfer speeds are limited to the speed of the USB ports in both machines and you will get faster throughput if your computers were manufactured after the first quarter of 2010. USB 3.0 is many times faster than the older specifications, but all versions of USB will work for creating a simple peer-to-peer network.Create a USB Mini-Network1. Before you connect the computers, make sure that they are compatible. You can use machines with different versions of Windows, but connecting different operating systems will not work properly. This is because different operating systems like Windows, OS X and Linux use different formats for storing files. Connecting incompatible computers will not cause damage to the machines, however. Even though the connection may work, you may not be able to use the files once they are transferred.2. As Gabriel Torres explains in the tutorial, ""Connecting Two PCs Using a USB to USB Cable,"" a USB bridged cable (also called a USB networking cable) is a special type of USB cable which has two of the characteristic flat, rectangular connector ends matching the connectors in your computers. To avoid power and data conflicts, a bridged cable contains electronics that organize the data flow. You could damage the ports and power supplies of the computers you are using if you do not use a bridged USB cable.3. Plug one end of the bridged USB cable into a free USB slot on each computer. Bridged cables do not share a power source. Some USB ports are only designed for data, and do not provide any power. You can use powered or non-powered USB ports when connecting computers directly.4. USB networking cables generally come with an installation disk. Insert the disk into the primary computer and follow the onscreen instructions. You will have a choice between link and network modes. Choose the network option. Setting up the computers as a link will allow you transfer files but will not allow you to share other resources such as printers and Internet access.Things Needed2 computers1 USB bridged cableUSB bridged cable installation softwareWarningsDo not use ordinary USB cables. Because the Universal Serial Bus is designed as a power source as well as for data transfer, using standard cables can result in damage to one or both computers.Do not connect a USB bridged cable to a hub or router. Bridged cables are designed specifically for computer-to-computer usage.References  (1)Resources  (1)About the AuthorRoger Golden began his career as a writer in 2008, when he began writing weekly insurance and personal finance articles.
