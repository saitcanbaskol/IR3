"Mango PowderSelect size:Medium Bottle, $6.3032Mango powder is ground from tart, unripe mangos which are sliced and sun-dried before grinding. Also known as amchur or amchoor powder, mangos are native to Southwest Asia. Most of us are familiar with mango’s delicious sweetness.This powder is actually the opposite; it’s a little bitter and quite sour. Mango powder is not actually a “spice” but it can be used as one to add sourness in the same way tamarind, lemon or lime juice does. This powder is most associated with Northern Indian cooking as it is used in their vegetarian dishes, curries, chutneys, pastries, soups and marinades.Nutritional InformationSalt-FreeSugar-FreeGluten-FreeNut-FreeVegetarian VeganMSG-FreeDairy-FreeGarlic-FreeOnion-FreeSweetener-FreeBlack Pepper-FreeCapsicum-FreeWe also recommendAjowan SeedsBroken Dried Curry LeavesAsafetidaFenugreek LeavesFenugreek SeedsRecipes & UsesVindaloo Ketchup & Pickle SamosasApple Chai ChutneyProduct Reviews"
