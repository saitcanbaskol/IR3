An embolus may consist of air, a blood clot, atherosclerotic plaque, or fatIschemia the decrease in or absence of blood supply to a localized area, usually related to vascular obstructionThrombus any organic or non-organic material blocking an artery; generally refers to a blood clot or atherosclerotic plaque but also includes fat or airPeripheral Vascular Surgery specialty of the arteries and veins lying outside the immediate area of the heart or brainTunica Externa (adventitia) composed of connective tissue and protects the vessel from injury and provides structural strengthTunica Media composed of inner layers of smooth muscle bounded by connective tissueTunica Initima secretes substances that cause vasodilation or constriction, as well as substances that prevent platelet aggregation in the vesselArteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the bodyPulmonary Arteries carry deoxygenated blood to the lungsThick-walled and highly elastic, and contain mostly smooth muscle arteriesSystole ventricular contractionDiastole the resting phase of the heartCapillaries microscopic vessels that function as the transition and exchange mechanism for oxygen and other substances between the vessel walls and the tissue cellsVenous System carries blood back to the heart from the peripheral tissuesThin Walled, which allows them to expand. Have valves that open only one way, preventing blood from backing up veinsPulmonary System carries blood from the heart to the lungs for oxygenationOxygenated Blood returns to the heart and is pumped into the systemic circulation, which reaches all tissues of the bodyWhat provides the primary pumping action for the heart ventriclesSystemic circulation oxygenated blood in the left ventricle is pumped through the ascending aorta to the rest of the body. Blood returning from the body passes from the capillaries into the venous system and returns to the left atrium through the vena cavaePulmonary circulation deoxygenated blood in the right ventricle is pumped through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs. Blood is oxygenated in the capillaries of the alveoli and returns to the left ventricle through the pulmonary veinsBlood Pressure the force exerted on the arterial wall by the pumping action of the heartSystolic Pressure the higher the pressure, occurs during contraction of the ventriclesDiastolic Pressure the lower the pressure, occurs during the relaxtion phase of the cardiac cycleHypertension abnormally high blood pressureHypotension negative alterations in blood pressureWhat is normal blood pressure affected by? age, gender, weight, daily fluctuation, exerciseWhat is the largest artery in the body? aortaThe aorta terminates at the pelvic bifurcation which forms _____ _______. iliac arteriesBrachiocephalic Artery gives rise to the right common carotid artery, which branches to the external carotid artery and the arteries of the brainWhat is the largest vein in the body? vena cavaWhat does the vena cava do? communicates with the heart through the right atriumSuperior vena cava receives deoxygenated blood from the head, neck, and upper extremitiesInferior vena cava receives blood from the lower body and extremitiesLymphatic System composed of ducts (vessels), regional lymph nodes, and lymph (fluids)Where are the lymph node located? intervals along the lymph ductsLymphocytes white blood cellsWhat are the diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease patients history, physical examination, routine blood testsArterial Plethysmography a pulse volume recorder is used to measure the arterial pulse waveform during systoleDoppler Scanning intensifies the sounds made by blood flowing through a vessel.
