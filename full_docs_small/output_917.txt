"Food & DrinkKorean food: The 12 essential dishes you need to know from the North and the SouthBy Dan GentilePublished On 02/27/2014@dannosphereFlickr/Chelsea Marie HicksThe Korean peninsula is such a powder keg of political tension that it's easy to forget that it's also a powerhouse of flavor. To serve as guides through the fog of war and into the steam of the kitchen, we enlisted two experts to school us on both Seoul food and Kim Jong cuisine: Holly (South) from Beyond Kimchee and Jae Jung (North), a New Orleans chef who's curated dinners that were actually attended by Kim Jong-un himself!Before you learn more about each country's individual specialties, here's a quick history lesson.CULINARY TRADITIONS Although there's currently little mingling between the North and South, there isn't necessarily a DMZ line drawn between the culinary traditions. Each culture serves a wide array of small side dishes (banchan), like kimchi and other pickled foods, with meals. Many dishes that originated in the North became South Korean staples as families migrated South after the war.Recommended VideoEatYou Can Get Reservations for Free Dinner in Taco Bell's Insane Test KitchenWatch MoreTHE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH CUISINE The differences are largely based on climate and economics: the colder mountainous regions of the North and high levels of poverty lead to blander flavors and a focus on sustenance over style, while the warmer South lends itself to spicier fare and a grander eating culture rooted in royal court cuisine.Flickr/USAG- HumphreysTHE SOUTHKimchiWhat it is: Fermented cabbage with chili flakes, garlic, ginger, and fish sauce What's the deal: ""Cabbage is the most common ingredient in kimchi, but there are over 200 different types.
