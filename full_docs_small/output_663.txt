This secondary amine is a colorless, flammable gas with an ammonia -like odor. Dimethylamine is commonly encountered commercially as a solution in water at concentrations up to around 40%. In 2005, an estimated 270,000 tons were produced industrially,  [5] but it is also found as a natural product.Contents [ hide ]1 Structure and properties2 Natural occurrence3 Uses4 Biochemistry5 Amido derivatives6 Toxicology7 See also8 References9 External linksStructure and properties  [ edit]The molecule consists of a nitrogen atom with two methyl substituents and one proton. Dimethylamine is a weak base and the pKa of the ammonium salt CH 3 -NH 2 + -CH 3 is 10.73, a value above methylamine  (10.64) and trimethylamine  (9.79).Dimethylamine reacts with acids to form salts, such as dimethylamine hydrochloride, an odorless white solid with a melting point of 171.5 °C. Dimethylamine is produced by catalytic reaction of methanol and ammonia at elevated temperatures and high pressure:  [6]2 CH 3 OH + NH 3 → (CH 3) 2 NH + 2 H 2 ONatural occurrence  [ edit]Dimethylamine is found quite widely distributed in animals and plants, and is present in many foods at the level of a few mg/kg.  [7]Uses  [ edit]Dimethylamine is a precursor to several industrially significant compounds.  [5]  [8] It reacts with carbon disulfide to give dimethyl dithiocarbamate, a precursor to a family of chemicals widely used in the vulcanization of rubber. The solvents dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide are derived from dimethylamine. It is raw material for the production of many agrichemicals and pharmaceuticals, such as dimefox and diphenhydramine, respectively. The chemical weapontabun is derived from dimethylamine. The surfactant lauryl dimethylamine oxide is found in soaps and cleaning compounds. Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, a rocket fuel, is prepared from dimethylamine.Biochemistry  [ edit]The German cockroach utilizes dimethylamine as a pheromone for communication.  [9]It is an attractant for boll weevils.  [10]Dimethylamine undergoes nitrosation under weak acid conditions to give dimethylnitrosamine. This animal carcinogen has been detected and quantified in human urine samples and it may also arise from nitrosation of dimethylamine by nitrogen oxides present in acid rain in highly industrialized countries.  [ citation needed]Amido derivatives  [ edit]Deprotonation of dimethylamine can be effected with organolithium compounds. The resulting LiNMe 2, which adopts a cluster-like structure, serves as a source of ""Me 2 N − "". This lithium amide has been used to prepare volatile metal complexes such as tetrakis (dimethylamido)titanium and pentakis (dimethylamido)tantalum.Toxicology  [ edit]Dimethylamine is not very toxic with the following LD 50 values: 736 mg/kg (mouse, i.p.); 316 mg/kg (mouse, p.o.); 698 mg/kg (rat, p.o.); 3900 mg/kg (rat, dermal); 240 mg/kg (guinea pig or rabbit, p.o.).
