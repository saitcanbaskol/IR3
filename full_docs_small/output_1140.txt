Therefore, at his own insistence, his name was excluded from the credits. Although he is not credited as Jason Voorhees in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984), he is credited for his scenes that were used in the opening montage for Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988). The death of Judie Aronson's character in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984) was filmed on a very cold December night. It was so cold out in the lake that Judie started crying. White became angry at director Joseph Zito for being so insensitive to her discomfort and threatened to quit if they didn't give her a break from being out in the cold water. Doubled for Clark Gable, John Wayne, Lee Marvin, and Fess Parker. Played football for the University of Oklahoma. Like most of the other stunt men who portrayed Jason Voorhees, White was chosen simply because the director needed a large man for the role.

GrahamHeight 6' 3"" (1.91 m) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Trivia Is the fifth actor to play Jason Voorhees in the Friday the 13th series. Was a nightclub owner prior to playing Jason Voorhees in ""Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives"". Was chosen to play Jason Voorhees as a last minute replacement for the sixth film because the stuntman who was chosen wasn't coming across with the power and menace that the director wanted. Was in the U.S. military from 1974-1978.Birth name Kane Warren Hodder ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Height 6' 31�2"" (1.92 m) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Spouse Susan B. Hodder (? - present) 2 children ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Trivia He played Jason Voorhees from 1988's Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988) to Jason X (2001). Says he's been told he was the largest baby ever born in Auburn, California (11 pounds, nine ounces).Kane's favorite Friday the 13th role was Jason X (2001).A good portion of his body was burned badly in a stunt mishap during the 1980s.One funny story that he likes to tell is that during the filming of Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988), his dressing room was a quarter of a mile down this dirt road. One night, at 2 AM filming had ended, he was still in the Jason costume, and he decided to walk through the woods on a path to his dressing room, as he was walking someone approached him, and asked him if he was with the movie, he didn't reply, because he thought it was a pretty stupid question to ask, here he was standing in full Jason costume. The man asked again, Kane took a little lunge for the guy, and grunted. The guy took off running, tripping and running. The next day director, John Buechler told Kane that the local sheriff was supposed to stop by, but he never showed.He spends time working with children in burn centers.Among his contributions to the Jason Voorhees character, Kane said that Jason should never have to run after his victims, nor would he hurt children and animals.He objected to the end of Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989) in which Jason is caught in a wave of toxic waste and reduced to a child, but the director disagreed with him.Aside from being the only actor to reprise the role of Jason Voorhees, he has also been the only actor to play three of the most infamous horror icons in the history of horror films. Besides playing Jason Voorhees in four different films, he also played Freddy Krueger's gloved hand at the end of Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993) and did the stunts for Leatherface in Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990).Has the word ""Kill!"" tatooed on the back of his bottom lip. Offered to reprise his role as Jason Voorhees in Freddy Vs. Jason (2003). But was turned down, because director Ronny Yu felt Hodder was too short and wanted an actor who would tower over Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) so he could create a David-and-Goliath sort of visual imagery between Jason and Freddy. Also, Yu wanted Jason to have more sympathetic eyes. Ken Kirzinger, won the role of Jason Voorhees, but the decision to not have Hodder return disappointed some fans of the genre, while other ""Friday The 13th"" fans were quite impressed with Ken Kirzinger's performance as Jason and felt he surpassed Kane. One of his favorite death scenes from his tenure as Jason Voorhees was the scene in Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988) where he picks up the girl in the sleeping bag and bashes her into the tree, a scene he recreated in Jason X (2001). Ironically, Kane said that he actually had difficulty pulling the original stunt off because the dummy that was in the bag was heavier than he thought it would be, so he had to re-shoot the scene over and over again because no matter how hard he swung the bag the director kept telling him it didn't look right. On the final take, Kane was so fed up with the situation that he threw bag on the ground and kicked in frustration. That was the shot that ended up in the film.Ken KirzingerHeight 6' 51�2"" (1.97 m) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Trivia Is the tallest out of the 8 actors to have played Jason Voorhees so far. Long before he took over the role of Jason Vorhees from Kane Hodder, Kirzinger appeared in ""Friday the 13th Part 8: Jason Takes Manhattan"" as a New York cook who gets in Jason/Kane's way when he is pursuing Jensen Daggett and Scott Reeves, and Kane threw the bigger Kirzinger over the counter. Was one of the stunt coordinators for Friday the 13th 8, Jason Takes Manhattan. Director Ronny Yu and the producers of ""Freddy Vs Jason"" tried to limit him doing his own stunts as much as possible. Brother is Dave Kirzinger, who was playing for the calgary Stampeders (CFL) from 1978 to 1986"
