It's not a requirement, but it can help smooth the  way.Getting a U.S. tourist visa can be challenging, because the U.S. government is worried about the number of people who use these as a way to enter the U.S. and then never leave or overstay. The aim of your letter would be to show the U.S. consular officer who considers the visa application that the person has a specific plan regarding visiting (and eventually leaving) the U.S., perhaps a place to stay, and will not need to find work in order to support him- or herself while here (if, that is, you plan to offer financial backup or support).You can give this letter to your friend or relative to take along to the U.S. consulate when her or she presents the application for a U.S. visitors' visa.What to Include in the Letter of InvitationThis should be a personal document, not something like a lawyer would  write, so don't stress over making it sound official. Make sure that you include both your and the recipient’s name and full address, for example using the format shown below.Also be sure to cover:the purpose of the planned visit, including what places you will visithow long the visitor will be staying with you or where you've made arrangements for he or she to staywhether you will be covering the person's transportation to and from the United States, andhow much of the person's expenses in the U.S., if any, you plan to cover.Be as specific and detailed as possible. Below is a sample letter for you to use as a guide.Sample Visitor’s Visa Invitation LetterMacy Newton 73 Savannah Court Washington, DC 20002 Home: 202-555-1212 Work: 202-555-2121Jim and Madeline Newton 114 Lime Grove Montego Bay, St. Mary’s Parish Jamaica, West IndiesSubject: Invitation to visit me in the U.S.Dear Mom and Uncle Jim:I would like to extend this invitation for you both to come and visit me in United States for three months.

It's available on the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov. (Click ""Forms,"" and then scroll down by number.) Or, you can provide both a letter and a Form I-134."
