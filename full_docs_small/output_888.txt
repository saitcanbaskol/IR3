But he agreed that ""a"" did not seem audible in the recording.Numerous intense studies have been carried out over the years, using high-tech equipment, all in the effort to discover whether he had indeed uttered that one little sound.In 2006, Peter Shann Ford said he had found the ""a"" in a study of the audio waveform, NASA explains. Then, ""more rigorous analyses of the transmission were undertaken by people with professional experience with audio waveforms and, most importantly, audio spectrograms. None of these analyses support Ford's conclusion.""First man on the moon gave rare interviewUntil now, perhaps.The MSU and OSU researchers took what they call a novel approach: studying how people from Armstrong's native central Ohio pronounce ""for"" and ""for a.""The team studied recordings of 40 people in Columbus, near Armstrong's native town of Wapakoneta. They found numerous examples of ""for"" and ""for a"" sounding similar.Their results suggest that it is entirely possible that Armstrong said what he claimed, though evidence indicates that people are statistically more likely to hear 'for man' instead of 'for a man' on the recording,"" Michigan State University said in a news release.""We feel we've partially vindicated him,"" Dilley said.
