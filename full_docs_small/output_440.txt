Hulu will retain streaming rights, scoring new episodes the day after they air on CMT.

Under the multiple avenues considered, CMT was always set to have first-run episodes.Read MoreLionsgate TV Chief Defends 'Nashville' Finale Cliffhanger, Says Alternative a ""Disservice""CMT and Hulu were among the multiple rumored potential homes for Nashville as producers Lionsgate Television remained steadfast in their pursuit of a fifth season after ABC canceled the drama in May. Lionsgate refused to accept that fate and opted to go with a massive cliffhanger in its season finale (billed as a series finale) involving Panettiere's Juliette Barnes. Her character's fate was left up in the air as her baby daddy Avery (Jonathan Jackson), waiting for her return at the airport, learned that her plane had gone missing. The series then cut to credits, leaving the fate of one of its leading ladies unclear as producers Lionsgate Television and ABC Studios actively shop the country music drama to other outlets.“CMT heard the fans. The wave of love and appreciation they have unleashed for Nashville has been overwhelming,” CMT president Brian Philips said. “ Nashville is a perfect addition to our evolving lineup of big music specials, documentaries and original series. We see our fans and ourselves in this show and we will treasure it like no other network. Nashville belongs on CMT.”""CMT and Hulu are the perfect combination for our iconic and beloved series Nashville and we want to thank the incredible fans for their unwavering support — #Nashies, you helped make this possible,” Lionsgate TV Group chairman Kevin Beggs said in a statement. “We also want to extend our appreciation to the State of Tennessee, City of Nashville, and Ryman Hospitality for their unending support. They have been a key ingredient to the continued success of this show and we’re thrilled to extend our partnership for a fifth season.”For Lionsgate's part, the independent studio actively started shopping Nashville immediately and has used its Twitter feed to keep the show's 8 million viewers posted on its efforts to find a new home. To hear Beggs tell it, efforts to find a new outlet for Nashville contributed to the cliffhanger finale — despite producers having also filmed what was ultimately a happy reunion for Juliette and Avery. (The cast all still have long-term deals to remain with the series as Lionsgate was adamant about securing a full 22-episode renewal. A CMT episode count remains unclear.)Read MoreABC Boss Explains Why 'Castle' and 'Nashville' Were Canceled""There's a little short-term pain but ultimately long-term gain because we intend and are quite focused and are in substantive and serious conversations with multiple buyers about continuing the show on another platform,"" Beggs told The Hollywood Reporter the day after the ABC finale. ""If we didn't feel that was going to happen, we might have gone a different way.""ABC's decision to cancel the series was among the biggest upfront shockers. Lionsgate signed Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick ( My So-Called Life, thirtysomething) to a sizable overall deal that included taking over for Dee Johnson as Nashville showrunners. The well respected duo had already set up and staffed a writers' room for season five in what many took as a show of confidence that the bubble drama — which scores a secondary revenue window from iTunes and concert ticket sales — would be back for another cycle.While most bubble series craft season enders that can also serve as a series finale — Nashville had done as much in the past — Beggs noted the ABC conclusion was the one that Johnson and series creator Callie Khouri originally planned.""The ending we ran was the ending always envisioned for this season,"" said Beggs. ""These things are crafted over weeks and months. In our estimation, to go with a quickly assembled too-easy wrap-up is more of a disservice to the fans who have invested four years in this great cast and these great stories. And there's more stories to tell.""See MoreNetwork Jumpers: 'Nashville,' 'Supergirl' and 17 Other TV Shows Saved by a Switch""We're not looking to write ourselves into a corner and actually wrapping up stories in a somewhat saccharine way is the worst box you can put yourself in,"" he said, noting he received another incoming call from a buyer following their recent earnings call.For CMT, Nashville will now anchor a rapidly growing scripted roster as the Viacom-owned cable network becomes the latest to enter the Peak TV fray. CMT has Billy Ray Cyrus starrer scripted comedy Still the King in the works as well as Million Dollar Quartet, an eight-episode limited drama.Nashville becomes the latest scripted series to jump from one network to another, though it's increasingly challenging for dramas to do so. Other recent network jumpers include Supergirl  (CBS to corporate sibling The CW); The Mindy Project  (Fox to Hulu), Community  (NBC to Yahoo), Longmire  (A&E to Netflix); Cougar Town  (ABC to TBS); and Damages  (FX to DirecTV), among others.Nashville"
