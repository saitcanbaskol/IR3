"Gidgetnavigation searchGidget is a fictional character created by author Frederick Kohner  (1905-86), based on his teenage daughter Kathy (now Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman) in his 1957 novel, Gidget, the Little Girl with Big Ideas. The novel follows the adventures of a teenage girl and her surfing friends on the beach at Malibu. The name Gidget is a portmanteau word of ""girl and midget "".  [1] Following the novel's publication, the character appeared in several films, television series and telemovies.Contents1 The Novels1.1 Gidget, the Little Girl with Big Ideas  (1957)1.2 Cher Papa  (1959)1.3 Gidget goes Hawaiian  (1961 novelization)1.4 The Affairs of Gidget  (1963)1.5 Gidget Goes to Rome  (1963 novelization)1.6 Gidget in Love  (1965)1.7 Gidget goes Parisienne  (1966)1.8 Gidget Goes New York (1968)2 Films2.1 Gidget  (1959)2.2 Gidget Goes Hawaiian  (1961)2.3 Gidget Goes to Rome  (1963)3 Television3.1 Gidget  (1965-66)3.2 The New Gidget  (1986-1988)3.3 Telemovies3.3.1 Gidget Grows Up  (1969)3.3.2 Gidget Gets Married  (1972)3.3.3 Gidget's Summer Reunion  (1985)4 References5 External linksThe Novels  [ edit]Frederick Kohner wrote eight ""Gidget"" novels, six of them original novels, two of them novelizations based on motion pictures with the same titles.Gidget, the Little Girl with Big Ideas  (1957)  [ edit]""I'm writing this down because I once heard that when you're getting older you're liable to forget things and I'd sure be the most miserable woman in this world if I ever forgot what happened this summer.""

[1]chapter fifteen, second last sentence (p.154 in current edition)Cher Papa  (1959)  [ edit]""He gave this a moment of thought.""Then he said, 'In love--I don't think I am. But I do like Franzie. I liked her from the day I saw her for the first time, out at Malibu on the board. She's got spunk and spirit. She's got warmth and enthusiasm. And--' he smiled diffidently, 'I like her particularly because I know that she likes me .'""I admit I was quite fascinated by this bit of self analysis.""'I am always ready to like a girl who likes me,' the Kahoona went on. 'You see, I am basically a shy person. It's always been hard for me to believe that a woman really liked me. So if it happens--well--I really want to hold onto it.' ""  [2]chapter fiveN.B. Cher Papa is unique among the novels in that it is narrated by Gidget's father rather than Gidget (Franzie) herself; the above quote is excerpted from a conversation between Gidget's father and the Kahoona. It is included because it speaks to the nature of Gidget as a human being, and the nature of her close friendship with the Kahoona.Gidget goes Hawaiian  (1961 novelization)  [ edit]""My friend the great Kahoona once told me that the sea is where we came in, and the sea is where we go out.

[3]chapter sevenThe Affairs of Gidget  (1963)  [ edit]""All the short years of my life I have been fascinated by the word 'affair.'""It sounds so decadent.And when I say short years, I say so advisedly. They have been painfully short, fifty-nine inches to be precise and that's stretching it.""  [4]chapter one, first few sentences""If you want to believe the Arabs, there are three things you can't hide: love, smoke and a man riding on the back of a camel.""I have news for the Arabs.""They have left out one other thing, and that thing is a toothache.""

[10]Funny thing about life: a few hours ago I hit the lowest point in my whole absolute existence, and now I'm riding so high I can't even see cloud nine when I look down. John would say that shows a lack of maturity, and I can't argue with him. When you're young it's not easy to level off and fly right.
