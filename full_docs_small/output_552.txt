"Health General Health Care Pain & Pain ManagementDo Xrays show pinched nerves?I think I have a pinched nerve in my neck, but I took an X-ray 6-8 months ago and it didn't show anything except my ligaments being loose in my neck. I am getting muscle/tension headaches everyday and am taking muscle relaxers but they can only do so much...Follow 9 answersAnswersRelevanceRatingNewestOldestBest Answer: X-rays are for bones only. An MRI is better for disks and such soft tissue. If you're looking at the nerves you want a nerve conduction study like electromyography (EMG). It sounds worse than it is. They run a mild current along the path of the nerve. They can hear the current as it passes by the electrode and see if it is intact or not. It's not comfortable or a good time but as tests go it's not that bad.

If you have a persistent pain, or painkillers are not helping you should see a doctor although a decent chiropractor may also help.Anonymous · 7 years ago0 0 CommentFor the best answers, search on this site https://shorturl.im/avRZ5 if it is lower back pain (flank pain) it could be a kidney infection. watch the color of your urine. if it is dark then you may need to drink more fluid. also you may need to see a doc for antibiotics if it has persisted this long. another thing is you need to give more details. what side is the pain on?? how is your bowel pattern? depending upon that, it could be appenditicitis, fibroids, bulging disk, spinal unalignment, etc. then again, it could be that you slept on it wrong, pulled something unknowingly, etc. With situations like these you need rest, don't lift heavy things, rest your back a bit. Moving around a lot only makes it hurt more and slows healing.Andree · 2 years ago0 0 Comment2Source (s):Fibroids Remedies http://teres.info/FibroidsNaturalTreatme...jay · 1 year ago0 0 CommentSounds like a lumbar disc bulge. An MRI would be a better diagnostic tool for this.Sandra · 2 years ago0 0 CommentNo, X-rays show hard structures like bone and metal.
