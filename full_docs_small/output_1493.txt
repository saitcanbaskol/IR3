Who determines what event the Soldier will do? Does the Soldier get to decide which event would be best for him/her, or does the NCOIC of the APFT decide what event he/she will do?Posts: 1 | Registered: 11 July 2011seven0821posted 11 July 2011 05:10 Hide PostGood question. I searched FM 21-20 and did not find the answer. Since the OIC or NCOIC is overall incharge of the APFT I am sure they would decide what is more practicle given location, weather, etc 9 times out of 10 the 2.5 mile walk is administered, it's just more convenient. The 6.2 mile stationary bike event more than likely means going to the gym The actual 6.2 mile bike would means the Soldier has a bike, borrowing a bike or renting one from the MWR or some sort The swim either needs to be in a 25m pool which is indoor or out and probably requires reservation. So the walk usually wins. If I am the Soldier on profile and I know an APFT is approaching, I would link up with the NCOIC to coordinate and try and push for my stronger event if possible.Posts: 494 | Registered: 24 December 2010NBC_NCOposted 11 July 2011 05:32 Hide PostIt's up to the descretion of the unit base on the equipment available to conduct the alternate event. I couldn't find anywhere in the old 21-20 where it spelled out. I have haven't seen it where the SM's preference decided the event.Posts: 6 | Registered: 09 July 2011NBC_NCOposted 11 July 2011 05:45 Hide PostAdditionally, I couldn't find a definative answer in FM 3-22.20 either.Posts: 6 | Registered: 09 July 201198C40_35N40posted 11 July 2011 10:49 Hide PostUsually if the Soldier has all three events checked, then it would go tot the APFT coordinator to determine which events CAN be accommodated. If only one or two events can be accommodated then the pool of choices dwindles down. If the Solder WANTS of thinks he/she NEEDS to do a specific event, say the Swim, then it is up to the SM and his/her physician to indicate that on the profile form. If no specific event is stated, then the administrator should choose. If the SM wants to argue that he or she has the choice of what event to take, then the SM can then try and find the supporting documentation to prove their point. Don’t be afraid to make the decision, make the judgment call based on the REGs you have read, and the fact that there is no for sure support for either argument. The burden of proof will then lie on the SM and the Physician. NCO's Lead The Way! SFC Nick Martinez B Co, 3rd MI BN (AE) Camp Humphreys, KOR “I am the punishment of God...

A soldier wlll have to do laps up and down the pool several times. 80% of our Soldiers couldn't do it with mmonths of training. Using the bike, it'll take more Soldiers then you think to do this even since you must keep the soldier in sight the intire event. Walking in a chore as well. Point being, never set our Soldiers up for failure. Maybe you should scheduled the unit up for these events durning PT..see who passes, maybe onePosts: 3 | Location: Lake Mary, F | Registered: 27 July 2011sysalisposted 27 July 2011 22:47 Hide PostAs a Training Room NCOIC the answer is this: If all three alternate events are checked on the profile, then it is up to the NCOIC administering the APFT. Usually it turns into what is more accommodating, but regardless it is up to the NCOIC of the APFT. The walk usually wins, FYI. At the same time, now that I think about it. It could also be explained in your unit SOP. Not sure about that one. My unit works with the NCOIC of the APFT chooses which event, which is the walk 99% of the time.

The Swim isnt that hard, as long as you practice some and If i ever have to take an alternate event thats the one I'm chosing. NCO's Lead The Way!

The 2-mile run event, or an approved alternate test event as outlined in FM 21–20, must be taken if the test is for record. The alternate test is for Soldiers with permanent physical profiles that prevent them from running 2 miles. Soldiers with temporary profiles of long duration (more than 3 months) may also take an alternate test if approved by the commander and health care personnel. Soldiers must be given 3 months to prepare for the alternate test from either the date of the profile or the date recommended by health care personnel. Now the logical thing would be to establish the alternate event with the 1SG or CDR, then give the Soldier the required 3 months to prepare. It is complete insanity to require a Soldier to train for three events when non permanent profile Soldier know exactly what the events are. To surprise somebody the day of the test is not taking care of the Soldiers and I believe is not inline with the above regulation. Take care of Soldiers.Posts: 209 | Registered: 25 March 2009sysalisposted 29 July 2011 22:20 Hide Postquote:Originally posted by InfantrytoSignal: The below is taken from AR 350-1, Section VI Army Training Programs, 1-24e (4)  (4) Personnel with permanent medical profiles that preclude participation in the pushup or situp event will take the remaining events if a physician or physician’s assistant approves.

That's why I'm currently in the process of fixing our section of the Training Room SOP to have alternate events default to be the walk (if multiple alternate events are selected) unless the SM wants to bike or swim. We have a gym right next to the track we run on, so we can do all three, easily. I'm also going to add that the SM needs to notify the training room at least 10 days in advance. That part will also be sent out to my units PSGs.

As I just stated in another post, you are a Specialist, therefore not an NCO, furthermore not an NCOIC of any thing. Lets just say you are the head guy in the Training Room. How many people do you even have under you? I am sorry but you are making me laugh, I am not saying a SGT could not be an NCOIC but when I hear that I ususally thinkof someone with 1 or more rocker. Lastly, I know all units are different but are you saying PSGs would have to contact you on the APFT and any events special event being administered? Why? Usually you are just the filing boy, a middle man to others to the 1SG and CO, a bitch boy in some eyes. My point being is lets slow our role.Posts: 494 | Registered: 24 December 201011B32Bposted 30 July 2011 10:14 Hide PostTake those rockers and shove them up your butt seven, lol. Just kidding. Get off the poor guys balls, atleast he's taking charge of his small part of the Army and trying to make it better after all right? It takes coordination with the gym facilities to ensure the pool or track is going to be used for a PT test here at FT Drum, the training room ""NCOIC"" has to coordinate this. I'm sure you know this, and our gym you need to let them know a few days in advance because every unit is trying to do this. I've personally only seen the bike event given once in my short career so far, and like you said most choose the walk, so there is really very little coordination involved in that, just ensuring that graders, OIC, and NCOIC as well as the Soldier doing the test know they will be doing it. Well anyways, I'm not purpously trying to pick apart your post or anything, just sticking up for poor sysalis, lol On a lighter note, I leave Monday for my 11b OSUT training and running next door for wings and RASP1! I'm praying to the Super Hooah Gods that everything works out fine and I leave with everything I have looked forward to and workedfor several years now!Posts: 405 | Location: Europe | Registered: 21 February 2011seven0821posted 30 July 2011 10:42 Hide PostNo, you are right LBeezy, I am breaking the guys balls I know the Training Room NCO can be used for a multitude of things, but I am more accustume to a Company APFT, the 1SG may place a SFC incharge and that SFC is responsible for APFT time, site and everything else that goes with that. Given, in some units Training Room may be responsible for coordination. When it is all said and done, LBeezy is right, and I do applaud you because you come off more mature and knowledgeable than your peers.....but I will break your balls to give myself a laugh, nothing personal. @LBeezy Have as much fun as you can bro, you will see OSUT is not tough. Most DS will treat you with some respect and put you incharge in their absence Airborne is a joke, prepare to be a Private all over again. And RASP... You know the deal...
