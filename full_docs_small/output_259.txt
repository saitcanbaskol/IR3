A lawsuit over the release won her an estimated $5 million, but it also threw her into the public eye. Most people in that position would shrink in shame, but Kardashian turned the tables on the embarrassing situation, turning it into a multi-million dollar TV and merchandise industry. Kim launched Keeping up with The Kardashians in 2007 and it has since produced an impressive 149 episodes. Kim splits the proceeds for that show with sisters Kourtney and Khloe. She has also released several successful fragrances and other merchandise, and signed a string of major endorsement deals. She has nearly 47 million Twitter followers and can reach nearly half a Super Bowl audience with a single tweet. The burglary of $10 million in jewels won’t hurt Kim’s net worth since the jewels were insured. Kim is reportedly suing an online magazine for claiming she faked the theft.Ready Vegas?
