"QuestionSubject: Frequency of the human eye Category: Science > Physics Asked by: eagleeye-ga List Price: $5.00 Posted: 27 Sep 2002 16:16 PDT Expires: 27 Oct 2002 15:16 PST Question ID: 69880When a wheel spins at a certain rate, it appears stationary to the human eye. I assume this has something to do with the frequency of the human eye relative to the frequency of rotation of the spinning wheel. What is this frequency? Similarly, on certain spinning items, which appear meaningless when stationary, you can suddenly read words and images once the item is spinning at a certain rate. How are these images created and who designs these images?Request for Question Clarification by alienintelligence-ga on 29 Sep 2002 00:26 PDTHi eagleeye,  From your question I have gotten the 2 main questions, 1) What is the human eye's field frequency 2) How do you exploit this CFF (Critical Flicker Frequency)  to simulate apparent images. 3) Who designs these images.  1 and 2... are easy to answer. 3, might require a clarification from you. Are you wanting manufacturers of these visual toys and gadgets? Or do you want to know the artists of the optical illusions?   thanks, -AIAnswerSubject: Re: Frequency of the human eye Answered By: drdavid-ga on 02 Oct 2002 15:16 PDTYou raise a number of important issues with your questions and comments, some of which have generated a lot of controversy over the course of far more than the 25 years you have been teaching speed-reading. However, most of the key experimental work is also at least that old, and those results still stand. You may wish to question some of the results and even do new experiments, but you would do well to start by reviewing the work that has already been done.  First, to answer your specific question about spinning tops, wheels and similar devices:  To the extent that any such device appears to freeze motion blur present in moving images, it does so by stroboscopic freezing of the image. The eye has no ""natural frequency"" which can do so on its own. There are different ways of implementing the strobe effect: strobe illumination, vibrating shutters, moving slits, but they all have the effect of giving you a short snapshot of the moving image, short enough in time to freeze the motion blur. The persistence of human vision may then prevent the image from appearing to flicker as long as the image repetition rate is fast enough (let’s say, greater than about 20 frames per second if you are willing to tolerate some flicker--modern computer displays generally use at least 60-80 frames per second to avoid any appearance of intensity flicker). Fluorescent illumination with common inexpensive ballasts generates a strobe effect at the line frequency (50 or 60 Hz) that can cause an unintended strobe illumination. Computer monitors, TVs and movie projectors also generate well-known unintended strobe effects for things like rotating wheels on vehicles.  That said, your real question has to do with training aids for speed-reading. First, how does fluent adult reading work? Much of the research was done by K Rayner et al:  EW McConkie & K Rayner, ""Identifying the Span of the Effective Stimulus in Reading: Literature and Theories of Reading,"" in H Singer & RB Ruddle, ed., ""Theoretical Models & Processes of Reading,"" International Reading Association, Newark, DE, 1976  K Rayner, ""Eye Movements in Reading and Information Processing,"" Psychological Bulletin, 85:618-60, 1978.  SE Taylor, ""Fluency in Silent Reading,"" Taylor Associates (Reading Plus) http://www.ta-comm.com/background/pedagogy/FluencyInSilentReading.pdf Fluent reading is about 10% saccadic motion (jumps between fixations) and 90% fixation. Average saccade length is 8-9 characters (range 2-18). About 10-20% of these are retrograde (backwards). Average fixation length is 200-250 ms (range 100-500). Within a fixation, you can perceive and recognize 2-3 characters to the left and 5-8 characters to the right (for a left-to-right language such as English). Word shape and other visual queues that can aid in planning saccades can be perceived over larger distances (up to about 12 character spaces to either side of fixation).  There is thus some possible room for training improved speed by trying to reduce fixation time toward 100 ms. This, I think, is what you hoped to achieve by your “spinning top.” To answer your question as to how to generate such training images, the easiest way is with a computer monitor. A monitor is inherently much faster than the 100-500 ms range you would be presenting. Whether artificial training aids which force a word presentation rate can decrease fixation time during normal reading is not clear or proven to my knowledge. However, it is probably only a small part of the skills that are trained in rapid fluent reading. Ten fixations per second at about one word per fixation would only get you to about 600 words per minute. To achieve the typical ""speed-reading"" claim of at least 1000 words per minute with high comprehension probably involves a number of speed strategies: skimming (skipping some words), knowing how to rapidly extract key words and concepts, looking for topic sentences and factual data, developing good test-taking skills. Whether it is even desirable to read 1000 words per minute for any material (such as textbooks) that must be studied in any depth is, of course, debatable as well, though an emphasis on reading efficiently with good comprehension is clearly worthwhile.

Each of these may need a different direction of research to find the answer you need. Let us know which it is.Subject: Re: Frequency of the human eye From: asterisk_man-ga on 27 Sep 2002 18:15 PDTFirst, I have a feeling that you may be confused. If you look directly at a spinning wheel it will simply look more blury the faster it spins. Under normal lightning conditions (not a stobe) it will not look like it is stopping or reversing or any other phenomonon you were expecting. The things you are describing are seen when there is some sampling of the position of the wheel such as with a strobe or with a video camera. I believe that you will find that all the spinning items that display something when spinning do so because various parts of the image become smeared together. If you can point to some specific examples of the spinning items you're thinking of I will try to explain them more specifically. Again, the human eye does not have a sampling frequency that would cause the undersampling effect you described.Subject: Re: Frequency of the human eye From: thenextguy-ga on 27 Sep 2002 21:25 PDTAre you talking about indoors, under fluorescent lights? Or in front of a TV in a darkened room? Those things will function as strobe lights.Subject: Re: Frequency of the human eye From: eagleeye-ga on 27 Sep 2002 22:48 PDTI am trying to investigate whether the human eye can be trained to increase its response to movement. I need to imprint words onto a disk. When stationary, the words are concealed in the clutter on the disk. When the disk is rotated at a particular speed, the words will become visible. Then if the disk is rotated even faster, can the eye be trained to adapt to the higher speed and still get to see the words. Firstly, I need to know how to create the digital image in such a way that the words only become visible at a certain speed of rotation. I once saw this effect achieved on a promotional spinning top. I have investigated this with collectors of unusual spinning tops - no success. I assume that it must be some sort of mathematical / digital effect. Some record players use this concept - a series of black and white lines on the side of the platter and a strobe light - when the white lines appear stationary, then you know that the turntable is spinning at the right speed. I want to apply the same concept to the human eye and then train the eye to respond to faster rates.Subject: Re: Frequency of the human eye From: eagleeye-ga on 27 Sep 2002 22:56 PDTI once saw a spinning top. When the top was stationary, the artwork appears to be a clutter of dots. When the top was spun, and reached a certain speed, the clutter resolved to a picture and words. I am trying to find such a top or someone to design such artwork. Then a want to measure the speeds of rotation for various people - the speed at which they can read the image/words. Then my gradually increasing the speed, ascertain whether they can adapt to higher speeds versus the untrained eye. This would not be under any artificial lighting conditions. I am doing this as part of my research into speed reading. Why can some people read and comprehend at many thousands of words a minute while others cannot? I have been teaching speed reading for 25 years and now want to start a scientific evaluation of these people.Subject: Re: Frequency of the human eye From: alan0-ga on 28 Sep 2002 00:02 PDTAn entirely different effect is the appearance of colour when spinning a top which only has black and white on it. I don't think that these effects have anything to do with the light source or strobing - but I could not find the theory. See the link below for examples of optical illusions with spinning tops.  http://www.archimedes-lab.org/atelier.html?http://www.archimedes-lab.org/workshoptop.html"
