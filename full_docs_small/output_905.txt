"Is SALT triggering your headaches? Cutting intake 'can reduce episodes by a third' (and you're probably eating way more than you think)Cutting salt from 9g to 3g a day reduced headaches by 31 per cent3g of salt a day is the equivalent to half a teaspoonA McDonald's Big Mac and fries contains around this amount of saltHigh salt foods include bread, tinned soups, cheese, pickles and cerealExperts said cutting salt reduces headaches as it lowers blood pressureSwitching from an unhealthy to a healthy diet had no effect on headachesResult was seen in people regardless of their blood pressure readingBy Madlen Davies for MailOnlinePublished: 13:06 EDT, 11 December 2014 | Updated: 14:39 EDT, 11 December 2014980shares49View commentsCutting down on salt could cut headaches by a third, according to new research.People who reduced their salt intake to three grams a day suffered significantly fewer headaches, a study found.Three grams of salt is the equivalent of around half a teaspoon, or the amount found in a McDonalds Big Mac and large fries.Experts said cutting salt could reduce headaches because it lowers blood and pulse pressure.Scroll down for videos+2Reducing salt intake to three grams cuts headaches by 31 per cent, a study found. Switching from an unhealthy diet to a healthy one made no difference to the frequency of headachesBut even people with normal blood pressure saw a reduction in headaches when they cut their salt intake.However, switching from a healthy diet to an unhealthy one had no effect on headaches, scientists said.As part of the study almost 400 people were randomly assigned either a low-fat diet rich in fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products or a typical Western diet as a control.Participants ate food with almost nine of salt a day for a set period, reflecting average salt consumption in the USA.RELATED ARTICLESPrevious 1 NextSugar is a greater enemy than SALT: Added sugars in...
