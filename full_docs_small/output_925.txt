He has grey skin with a green circuit-like design on it. Nanomech possesses green wings as well as one large, green cyclopean-eye. His body is a carbon/silicon-based alloy, and he has triangular feet. He wears the Omnitrix / Ultimatrix symbol on his chest.From a human-sized perspective, when Nanomech speaks, he has a squeaky high pitched voice, but from anything of his size's perspective, his voice is very deep.In Omniverse, Nanomech's circuit design is gone, being replaced with a design pushing more to his Alien Swarm design, and the Omnitrix symbol is where his eye was. He has different wings, he speaks with a more robotic tone, but still high-pitched and he has four small eyes around the Omnitrix similar to Stinkfly. His legs have also changed shape. His body also emits a bright green glow that completely surrounds him.Powers and AbilitiesNanomech's bioelectricity and flightNanomech has the ability to fly. He is very agile, and his wings glow when he is airborne.Nanomech can reduce his size at will, even to microscopic scales. He can return to his original size, but cannot grow any larger.Nanomech can launch green bioelectrical energy from his hands and eye, ranging in forms from beams to orbs.Nanomech has the ability to adapt to his opponents very fast, such as sprouting energy tentacles like the Decoy Queen seconds after she attacked him with it.Because he is a hybrid, Nanomech can't be controlled by Nanochip Queens.WeaknessesNanomech's size can be a problem if fighting larger opponents as seen when Kevin as Nanomech was harmed by a fly swatter.  [1]Even though Nanomech can't be controlled by Nanochip Queens, he can still be partially influenced by them.HistoryBenNanomech first appeared in Ben 10: Alien Swarm.
