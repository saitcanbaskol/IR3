"Answer 1:This is one of the most important questions in biology since the cell is the smallest unit of life in either a plant or an animal and without it no living thing would survive. No matter what organism the cell comes from it has the same basic functions. Cells must be able to get nutrients from the environment, make new cells (reproduce) and use the nutrients to make energy for the organism they are a part of. There are many, many, many other things a cell can do in addition to there three things, for example, cells get rid of waste, send electrical signals to the brain, fight off disease, carry oxygen through the body and in the case of plants they make energy from sunlight.Although, the overall function of the cell is the same, there are some important differences between animal and plant cells. The first difference is that plant cells have an organelle called chloroplast. Chloroplasts contain a pigment called chlorophyll (which gives the plant its green color). Chlorophyll is able to capture the energy from the sun. In doing this a series of chemical reactions occur that convert the suns energy into ATP (energy for the plant). The second main difference is in the structure of the cell itself. Animal cells are smaller than plant cells and have a membrane around them that is flexible and allows molecules, gases and nutrients to pass into the cell. Plant cells are larger and in addition to a membrane they have a rigid cell wall. The cell wall does not let any material pass so instead the plants cells must have tiny openings between cells like doors between rooms in your house. These ""doors"" are called plasmodesmata. The plant cell wall provides protection to the plant cell just like the animal cell does.Here is a really nice table I found on line that lists similarities and differences between the two. In case your curiosity gets the best of you.table 1"
