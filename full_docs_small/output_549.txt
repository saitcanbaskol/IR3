"Mechanical Ventilation--Types and ModesINPV came into use during poliomyelitis epidemics. Development of a subatmospheric pressure around the thorax and abdomen results in air being drawn into the lungs through the mouth and nose. When the pressure around the chest wall returns to that of the surrounding air, expiration occurs passively owing to the elastic recoil of the lungs and chest wall.  [ 4] However, during the poliomyelitis epidemic mortality decreased from 87% to 40% when INPV was replaced by positive-pressure ventilation.  [ 5]The place of INPV in acute exacerbations of COPD is still discussed: iron lung, cuirass and poncho-wrap ventilators have been used in exacerbations of COPD.  [ 4] In no study was INPV used in the place of invasive MV. More recently, an uncontrolled retrospective study on 150 consecutive patients with ARF and hypercapnic coma by Corrado and colleagues  [ 6] showed that treatment by means of iron lung was associated with a success rate of 70%, and a mortality rate of 24% mortality rate. 6% of patients required EI.Intermittent positive pressure ventilation delivers a tidal volume (VT) and then allows passive exhalation, either to atmospheric pressure or to a set positive airway pressure. The technique can be used to control ventilation entirely or to increase spontaneous respiratory efforts. Increasing gas exchange can be achieved for conscious subjects only if the ventilator cycles into inspiration in response to the initiation of a spontaneous breath by the patient, a process described as ""triggering"" (""assisted ventilation""). If there is no spontaneous inspiratory effort or it is too weak to trigger the ventilator, an automatic cycle must be imposed to ensure that gas exchange continues (""controlled ventilation""). The assist/control (A/C) mode can be used to ensure that breaths are either triggered or imposed.  [ 7]Pressure support ventilation (PSV) is an assisted mode of ventilation supplying a set level of positive airway pressure during spontaneous inspiratory efforts. PSV can either totally or partially unload inspiratory muscles during spontaneous breathing. PSV allows the patient to maintain control of inspiratory and expiratory time and to interact with a set pressure to determine the ultimate flow and VT.  [ 8]nMV delivered in control mode is able to significantly unload inspiratory muscles both in obstructive and in restrictive patients.  [ 9] In stable COPD patients non-invasive PSV (nPSV) increases minute ventilation and VT, and reduces breathing frequency while improving gas exchange.  [ 10] It is able to unload inspiratory muscles both in chronic and acute conditions. The addition of external positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPe) is able to further reduce diaphragmatic effort and its oxygen consumption both in stable COPD and during acute exacerbations.
