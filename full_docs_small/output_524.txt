"Kuter666 Member Jul-27-2015 04:18 PMPending Authorization...what's that?So today i made a purchase on a website with paypal and at the check-out the website glitched out and said it was under maintenance, but i got an email from paypal claiming that i did the purchase and i did not receive what i had bought (virtual money for a game), and now my money has been taken and i have a [Pending] Authorization in my transaction list and the company i purchased the virtual money of, has no record of me buying it. I have no idea what the **bleep** it is, even paypal Q&A doesn't have anything, some enlightement would be good..1 Kudo"
