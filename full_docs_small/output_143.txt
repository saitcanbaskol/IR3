Are they unique serial numbers (similar to R2-D2 and C-3PO)? The fact that the names are written in all caps on their bodies lends weight to the idea that they may be acronyms.I'm hoping for an in-universe answer if possible. It wouldn't make much sense for the military to name them after people who assisted in the creation of the film.interstellarshare improve this questionedited Nov 14 '14 at 11:45asked Nov 12 '14 at 17:26phantom42105k 38 455 668Minor note: didn't TARS first appear at the gate of the secret NASA base, decking Coop while Murph waited in the truck? – Brian Warshaw Nov 12 '14 at 17:323And written in Braille below, of course. Painted Braille, which means it's largely useless for blind people... One theory posted on the wiki: ""Tars is an anagram for star. As he is the star of the robots and it's a spacy name. By the way the other two robots are kipp and case. Kipp is for kip Thorne who was the scientific advisor. Kipp has an extra p to lend case which is ok because he is a pile of parts anyway. With a p case is now an anagram for space."" – FuzzyBoots Nov 14 '14 at 22:251Simple, TARS for TERMINATARS.... – user41799 Feb 13 '15 at 13:391Here's my little theory: Take a look at TARkovsky's Solaris, especially the interior design: cdn1.sbnation.com/assets/4033679/4.jpg – armin Jun 20 '15 at 22:55add a comment1 Answer active oldest votesup vote6down voteAccording to this Wired article  (which includes information from Nolan) the names do not stand for anything.While Christopher Nolan was making Interstellar, he decided to show a  model of the movie’s bots to his kids. They were extremely  disappointed. “That’s not a robot,” they told him. “That’s a box.”  Well, it’s true: Nolan’s intelligent machines, which he dreamed up  with production designer Nathan Crowley, look for all the universe  like slabs of metal. The main bot, named TARS (which doesn’t stand for  anything), might as well be a distant cousin of 2001‘s monolith. Then  again, nothing in Nolan’s world (s) is what it seems. “When I let my  kids play with the model, open it up, see different combinations,” he  says, “they started getting really excited.” Let’s peek inside the  box.share improve this answeredited Feb 13 '15 at 14:02Valorum340k 87 25072737answered Jan 6 '15 at 2:06Organic Marble19k 3 66 102They may not stand for anything, but do they have any in-universe significance? – phantom42 Jan 6 '15 at 3:20add a commentprotected by Community ♦ Feb 13 '15 at 13:58Thank you for your interest in this question.
