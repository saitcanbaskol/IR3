"SD Seth D asked onNovember 16, 2009Q: Network storage accessible only if path includes IP address; not via ""Network""I can access my networked Iomega Home Network drive by creating a Network Place Shortcut to its static (local) IP address (\\192.168.1...). However, whenever I try to open it by double-clicking it in Network (where its name is STORAGE-2457), I get the  following error: \\STORAGE-2457 is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions.Network error (1208).It worked properly over the network with Windows XP, but it hasn't with Windows Vista or Windows 7. Iomega is no longer supporting the drive, but why is it broken in Windows Vista/7? I have read some about setting LMCompatibilityFlag, but I never got such a ""fix"" to work; only the IP address workaround has been successful. What is going wrong?ReplyI have the same question (3)Samhrutha G replied onNovember 17, 2009MicrosoftA:Hi Seth  D,Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!I would recommend you to try ping the name of the server to the STORAGE-2457.
