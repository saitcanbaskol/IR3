For two years (1982 - 1984), she played ""Aunt Fran"" on Mama's Family  (1983) until her character was killed off and she joined the cast of Golden Girls. She hit her comedic stride as a sharp tongued oversexed Southern belle on The Golden Girls  (1985).- IMDb Mini Biography By: Ray HamelA veteran television actress and Broadway star of the 50s, Rue McClanahan was born Eddi-Rue McClanahan in Healdton, Oklahoma, to Dreda Rheua-Nell (Medaris), a beautician, and William Edwin McClanahan, a building contractor.

McClanahan next co-starred with Vicki Lawrence, Ken Berry, Betty White and Carol Burnett in Mama's Family  (1983) for three years, and, after it was canceled by NBC, McClanahan was probably best known for her role as the saucy, sharp southern belle, ""Blanche Devereaux"", in The Golden Girls  (1985). She once again worked with Bea Arthur and Betty White, and with relative newcomer Estelle Getty. All four of the women won Emmy Awards for their roles. After Bea Arthur left the show after seven seasons, McClanahan, White and Getty returned for a brief spin-off in The Golden Palace  (1992).

However, Betty had already been the aggressive Sue Ann Nivens on Mary Tyler Moore  (1970) and Rue had played the introverted Vivian on Maude  (1972). It was thought best not to typecast these two actresses by having them portray similar characters. Therefore, Betty got the part of naive Rose Nylund and Rue played the oversexed Blanche.Was a vegan and dedicated animal rights activist.She was an Honorary Director for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.Suffered a minor stroke while recovering from heart bypass surgery, which she had in November 2009 [January 14, 2010].After moving to New York City, she worked as a file clerk before finding success in the theater.Was estranged (in 2009) from her sixth husband, Morrow Wilson at the time of her death.Upon her death, she was cremated.She was a lifelong liberal Democrat.

[June 2005]Spoke at a press conference at Saratoga Springs, New York protesting the use of diving horses at Magic Forest Theme Park, Lake George, New York. [May 2003]She was inducted into the 2015 inaugural Closter Hall of Fame in Closter, New Jersey.During ""Ashes to Ashes"" filming, on an early morning at Universal City's studio stage, director Patrick McGoohan blocked and rehearsed the vitriolic murder scene in the stage set's funeral home mortuary complex; in the embalming mortuary laboratory crematorium suite. The scene is between 'Patrick Prince' (Patrick McGoohan) as he strangles his former lover 'Verity Chandler' (Rue McClanahan). The scene's action and motivation involves 'Verity Chandler' - a nasty devious miserably wicked evil tongued Hollywood gossip columnist and the funeral home's owner/mortician 'Patrick Prince' who is seething with resentment, controlled anger with murderous blood thirsty revenge to kill; like two fascinating characters composed of Shaw, Chekov and Shakespeare. The scene's action begins in the funeral home's foyer/viewing chapel when Prince invites his manipulated butterfly Verity into his inner-sanctum preparation laboratory lair. Once inside the lab, Prince locks the entry-door, closing in on his beautiful unprepared victim Verity Chandler like a spider spinning his web. The murder scene (as scripted) had specific dialogue but no staged motivation. Observing the two actors initially block their motivation and movement, after entering the lab, with director/actor Patrick's basic plan, was like observing two actors choreographing their pas de deux outcome of a complex sequence of the eventful scene! Interestingly, the lab had a sink wall with a mirror above the sink tub crib. Patrick with McClanahan, together, blocked the scene entirely focused on the camera's point of view, using the mirror as a second camera capturing their facial reactions during their pas de deux denouement. Rehearsing the scene together, with the entire crew standing on the side-line, was fascinating observing the two actors create and develop their confrontation for the scene's climax.While filming a ""Colombo - 'Ashes to Ashes' "" (Movie of the Week in the Spring of 1998) at Universal-MCA Film City-Studios, Rue McClanahan performed in a guest role, as 'Verity Chandler' - a nasty devious miserably wicked evil tongued Hollywood gossip columnist - on Peter Falk's ""Columbo"" MOW prime-time-network special. The film was written by, directed, and featured actor Patrick McGoohan - as Eric Prince, seething with resentment of his ex-lover Verity, murderous and bloodthirsty for revenge. During breaks in filming, Rue McClanahan related to Falk's production designer Hub Braden's question when asked - ""In 'The Golden Girls' series - how much did each of the featured performers contribute, ad-lib, improvise in their first Monday sit-down read of their dialogue for their character's role?"" McClanahan's response was a matter-of-fact statement to his inquiry! ""Not much! Bea Arthur arrived in the rehearsal hall, just sat at the conference table and read her lines. Ditto for Estelle Getty. Betty White and myself would interject comments, and usually, our ad-lib/improv dialogue ideas were noted, accepted by Susan Harris, with our spontaneous line idea interjected into our current script. Bea Arthur performed, reading exactly, what she had been given to say; the same, as well - with Estelle. Betty and myself were usually animated in our dialogue readings, bouncing off with an ad-lib or other flippant dialogue. We all delivered our lines exactly as scripted in our final live television performances. We never improvised in filming. Bea and Estelle were full-filling their acting-job during rehearsals and performances! We were all very professional!"".Friends with Bea Arthur, Betty White, Richard Mulligan, and Esther Rolle.Personal Quotes (3)Compassion is the foundation of everything positive, everything good. If you carry the power of compassion to the marketplace and the dinner table, you can make your life really count.People always ask me if I'm like Blanche. And I say, ""Well, Blanche was an oversexed, self-involved, man-crazy, vain Southern belle from Atlanta -- and I'm not from Atlanta!"" [on her religion when asked about it] Yes, I am a Methodist. I have been affiliated with the Methodist church since I was a child and I must say that I simply love it! There are three things in this world that I love; animals, my Golden Girls and being a Methodist. I can't fathom being a member in any other religion than the Methodist church. It is so relaxed and welcoming and you can just be yourself while worshiping with no strings attached. I am very proud to be a member in the Methodist church!Salary (1)The Golden Girls  (1985) $100,000 (last season)"
