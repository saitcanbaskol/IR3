I don't think this website offers any brokerage service. So you need to wait for someone who just steps in to this forum and forwards an advertisement! Its better you look for insurance agents nearby. thanks, Thelma_Clergyman_________________ Register Now to have your Insurance queries solved.Thelma_ClergymanGuestPosted: Tue Mar 13, 2007 7:00 pm Post subject: Insurance for CaterersBecause Catering is your actual business, it does not qualify for 'one-time' or single-event insurance programs. However, a typical business insurance policy for $1,000,000 General Liability for a catering service runs about $800-$1100/a year. This type of policy will include products/completed operations, personal injury/advertising injury, fire damage and medical payments coverage for every single event you may do over a 12-month period. This is extremely affordable considering if a claim or lawsuit was made against you and your company, it would be difficult to defend or settle it out of pocket and still keep your business running. If you need insurance for your catering business, give me a call or send an e-mail. It only takes a day or two for me to shop the best rates and program for a catering business, plus I can even get coverage if your business does events in more than one state.

DennisGuestPosted: Thu Mar 15, 2007 2:15 am Post subject:Hello! Well if I can step in here a moment. I did used to write a policy for people that were holding a one day catering event. If you are in the state of PA or NJ hey I can help you out. If you are not in either state, look in the phone book and call and agency, a company that deals with multiple companies. You should be able to do this and there are companies out there that do write these one or two day events. If you cannot find one let me know I can make a phone call or two and find a company for you...I need to know what state you are in though._________________ ~Monique~nique1221Senior member Joined: 25 Nov 2006 Posts: 287 Location: PA 49.08 Dollars ($)Posted: Sat Jan 03, 2009 9:14 pm Post subject: starting a small catering serviceDo i need insurance if the event is for a graduation party,office meeting,or any type of one day function?_________________ Register Now to have your Insurance queries solved.ConcernedGuestPosted: Thu Mar 26, 2009 3:48 am Post subject:Hi, I have a question for you! My family is doing the catering for my wedding, however the event site requires a certificate of general liability showing a limit of 500,000 for bodily injury and property damage and it is required from the caterer. How do i go about obtaining this and how much would it cost. My family is set on doing the catering, but i'm not sure what the benefit vs. cost would be. Thanks so much!_________________ Register Now to have your Insurance queries solved.?????????GuestPosted: Fri Feb 26, 2010 10:59 pm Post subject: 1 day insurance for catererI have a friend who I want to cater my daughters wedding and he was told by the wedding planner that he would need $1,000.000 in insurance.

You have many grammatical errors and poorly written text in general. But, yes, why would you not include the need for liability (and property) insurance to protect one's investment in their business. One simple case of ""food poisoning"" is all it takes to put a small business out of business. Since most small, startup caterers are going to be sole proprietors, they are exposing all of their personal assets, such as their home, their savings, EVERYTHING they own, to the risk of loss in the event of a single act of negligence._________________ CA-licensed Life & Disability Analyst.
