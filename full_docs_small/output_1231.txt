You have to have 'implants' though, thats how it works. Your Dentist will refer you out to see a Periodontist and an Oral surgeon, in your area, for an evaulation. If he (Perio. doc) thinks this treatment is best for you, he'll get you set up for the 'implant' cases with (Oral surg.). Basicaly, they will do a minor gum/bone surgery to place implants into your bone. They look like little screws. You'll have 2 placed on the upper and 2 on the lower. IF your having BOTH dentures done. Anyways, after that treatment is done, you'll go back to your Dentist and he'll proceed on with taking the impressions with your implants for your dentures. The lab will simply make your dentures like all other dentures, except they'll have places in the dentures that will be able to snap in place to the implants and hold them in. The dentures will still be removable, of course. You do have to keep them clean and brushed like normal teeth. Now this procedure isnt an over the night process, its very time consuming. You'll have to have several weeks of healing after your surgery/ impants. BUT.. its well worth it. And it is costly as well (implants for 4 + surgery, are around $5000, and the dentures will be roughly $900)... BUt again, worth it. You'll highly enjoy your results, and you wont have to fight with your dentures trying to keep them in place, as your bone/ridge deteriorates over time. I've havent heard a patient yet to complain, they love them. So will you. *All 3 doctors, will be involved in your case. BUT, worth it. **There are different types of Implant/Denture Styles.. ask your Dentist, which is best for you!Source (s):Applied Science Degree~ of Dental Technology Dental Tech~ 14 yrs and still going...debs · 1 decade ago8 0 1 commentSnap In DenturesSource (s):https://shrink.im/a8w9gcontes · 2 years ago0 0 CommentYou will need your lower full denture retained by implants. These are titanium cylinders placed into your lower jaw bone by an oral surgeon. They then integrate directly into the bone. Your dentist then places ""caps"" over the implants and the caps are connected by a metal bar or bars - the lower denture has clips fitted underneath which snap onto the bars. These kinds of full dentures are INFINITELY better than a full lower w/o implants. Each implant is probably a couple thousand to place (oral surgeons dont' work cheap!) and then the bar/clip complex is a few hundred and the lower denture is maybe 12-1500. You will need at least two implants to anchor the whole apparatus, but three or four will work better. The cost, of course, goes up w/ each implant. Good luck, and if the overall cost is too much, try looking into having residents do this at a dental school with a prosthodontic program.Source (s):drnate.blogspot.comdrswansondds · 1 decade ago1 0 2 commentsRE: How do snap in dentures stay in place?
