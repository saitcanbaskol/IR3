He finds a glimmer of hope in the mysterious, Ã¼ber-cool and beautiful Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and with the aim of winning her heart he invites her to star in his band's music videos. There's only one problem: he's not part of a band...yet. She agrees, and now Conor must deliver what he's promised - calling himself ""Cosmo"" and immersing himself in the vibrant rock music trends of the decade, he forms a band with a few lads, and the group pours their heart into writing lyrics and shooting videos. Inspired by writer/director John Carney's life and love for music, SING STREET shows us a world where music has the power to take us away from the turmoil of everyday life and transform us into something greater.Rating: PG-13 (for thematic elements including strong language and some bullying behavior, a suggestive image, drug material and teen smoking)Genre: Art House & International, Drama, Musical & Performing ArtsDirected By: John CarneyWritten By: John CarneyIn Theaters: Apr 15, 2016 limitedOn Disc/Streaming: Jul 26, 2016Box Office: $3,233,839Runtime: 106 minutesStudio: Likely StoryWatch it nowCastFerdia Walsh-Peeloas CosmoLucy Boyntonas RaphinaJack Reynoras BrendanMaria Doyle Kennedyas PennyAidan Gillenas RobertKelly Thornton (II)as AnnView All"
