"Here you will find blogs, information and media on this seminal South African Band.For the Official Mango Groove Website, Booking and Gig details go to http:// www.mangogroove.co.za /As a true phenomenon on the South African music scene, Mango Groove needs very little introduction: Having cut its teeth on the mid-80’s SA alternative music scene (difficult times indeed for non racial South African acts), the group exploded into the national consciousness with the release of its 6 times Platinum debut album in 1989. Since then the group, with its uniquely eclectic, Big Band ‘’Marabi-Pop’’ sound has truly captured the hearts of all South Africans both here and all around the world. Fronted by the amazing Claire Johnston, and featuring the super-distinctive texturing of legendary SA penny whistler Mduduzi Magwaza, Mango Groove has racked up a host of achievements throughout the years, and has firmly established itself as one of the World’s most recognised and loved South African music icons.In 2010 Claire Johnston Performed a medley of Mango Groove Hits on the Afrikaans show Skouspel Plus.

The album was the culmination of several years of false starts and the sorts of experiences so typically associated with a multi-generational, non-racial band trying to make its way through South Africa in the ‘80’s. These were the times of near-miss record deals, lofty and unfulfilled promises, Doornfontein Disco No-Shows, End Conscription Campaign bashes, higgledy-piggledy varsity tours and Jameson’s late-nighters. With the release of the first album, everything changed, and the group hurtled into a maelstrom of unforgettable adventures and heady experiences Sales of the first album alone rocketed to over 250 000, with3 multi-platinum albums following, and for the following few years Mango took on the country in a series of spectacular shows and tours that continue to hold SA records today: 6 consecutive sold-out shows at the Standard Bank arena ( (at over 6 000 people per show in one weekend, nogal!), 6 sold-out shows at the Sun City Superbowl, and an astonishing 25 000 people at Greenpoint Stadium, Cape Town (an absolute first for any SA act).In 1986 Mango Groove Released “We are Party” on 12″ Vinyl and Cassette tape.The B side featured Telephone Lover.The Bands first Hit single.

Entitled ‘Moments Away: Love Songs and Lullabies 1990-2006’, the CD is a glorious collection of hits and memories, which also features some brand new tracks, the first from Mango Groove in several years.‘ ’Love Songs and Lullabies’’Musically, when one first thinks of Mango Groove, certain key things come to mind: Claire’s inimitable and soaring vocals, thundering Marabi horns, punchy swing rhythms, gumboots and pennywhistles. With this in mind, the selection of songs on this album reflects a different and perhaps more introspective side to the group: These are the anthems, love songs and lullabies that were scattered across the 6 Mango Groove albums of the last 15 years. And yes, listening to them all, one is struck by how achingly familiar so many of the songs are. They say that music is in someway a soundtrack to our lives. If this is the case, these songs form an essential part of that unique and complicated metamorphosis that we as South Africans experienced through the momentous, poignant, troubling and ultimately liberating times of ‘80’s and 90’s South Africa. It would take a volume to recount the sorts of unforgettable experiences associated with these tracks, but certainly some of these are indelibly etched in our memories:‘’Another Country’’: written as a response to the events surrounding the Boipatong massacre, and featuring astonishing and ground breaking visuals by internationally-renowned SA artist William Kentridge.‘’Moments Away’’: Mango Groove’s biggest selling love song.

This is not to say that the founder members haven’t been busy.As John explains, ‘the decision to put Mango Groove on a relative backburner was primarily a creative one on our part. We have had so much support from the SA public and media through the years: sales on the old albums are still great, and we continue to receive amazing airplay across all station. On the back of this, I suppose, and after many years of fairly intense touring and recording, we definitely felt the urge to explore other projects and other creative outlets. So, sit back, soak up the memories and experience the unique and bittersweet sounds of a great collection of South African love songs and lullabies.Mango Groove-Moments AwayYour browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available.

Jubilantly titled ‘Bang The Drum’, this 16 track album clocks in at close to 70 minutes, delivering a listening experience that is quintessentially Mango Groove, with some 21st century elements. Ask the band to describe the music on ‘Bang The Drum’ and they’ll tell you that they have aimed to recapture “that unique Mango Groove sound that has captured the hearts of so many South Africans but with all the freshness and energy that is Pure Post-Millennial World Pop”. What’s also evident is how instantly recognisable singer Claire Johnston’s vocals are. Johnston’s powerful but easily accessible voice has always been among Mango Groove’s most potent calling cards. But what has always made Mango Groove such a compelling act is the unique combination of Johnston’s voice with musicians and multiple backing vocalists on songs that merge beloved South African music styles –among them Marabi, Jive and Kwela –with pop. Indeed, it’s for their hundreds of thousands of fans that Mango Groove have so lovingly created ‘Bang The Drum’.Claire Johnston-My Blue OceanYour browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available.
