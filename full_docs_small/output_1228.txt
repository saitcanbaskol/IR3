The reward for those years of grueling labor is a high level of earning power. However, while all doctors earn an enviable salary by most standards, there's a wide discrepancy in pay between different areas of medicine. Average salaries can range from under $200,000 per year to over $700,000, depending on the physician's specialty.Primary Care PhysiciansPrimary care physicians are the doctors who provide front line health care to patients. Family doctors, internists, pediatricians and gynecologists all fall into this category.

It found a range of average salaries for family medicine beginning at $162,908 per year and rising to $221,196. For pediatricians, average salaries started at $161,732 and rose to $229,041 per year. The salaries for internists ranged from a low of $188,500 to a high of $236,544 per year. Obstetrics and gynecology paid slightly better, with average salaries ranging from $247,680 at the low end to $420,000 at the high end.SpecialistsSome physicians specialize in specific diseases, such as cancer, or specific systems or areas within the body, such as urology. These more focused areas of medicine tend to be more lucrative. ""Modern Healthcare"" reported an average salary range of $315,000 to $457,000 per year for oncologists, while urologists' average salaries started at $347,500 and rose to $453,000 per year.

For orthopedic surgeons the range started at $378,062 and rose to $576,350 per year. For plastic and reconstructive surgeons, the range of average salaries began at $360,000 per year and rose to $450,00. Some surgical specialties can pay significantly more.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that demand for physicians and surgeons will grow by 24 percent between 2010 and 2020, much faster than the average for all occupations. The growing population of the United States will drive part of the demand, as will the need among baby boomers to seek more medical care as they age. Opportunities will be particularly plentiful for physicians who specialize in orthopedic surgery, cardiology and oncology, which are in high demand among older patients.
