"Isosceles Triangle TheoremSub TopicsIsosceles Triangle Theorem ProofConverse of the Isosceles Triangle TheoremIsosceles triangle is a classification done on the basis of the sides of a triangle. An isosceles triangle is defined to be a triangle with at least two congruent sides. This makes an equilateral triangle (all the three sides are congruent) also a special type of an isosceles triangle. Special names are given to the sides and the angles of an isosceles triangle.The congruent sides are called the legsThe non congruent side is called the base of the isosceles triangle.The angles made on the base are called the base angles.The angle made by the intersection of the congruent sides is called the vertical angle.The Isosceles triangle theorem states the base angle property of an isosceles triangle.Isosceles Triangle TheoremIsosceles Triangle Theorem Definition: If two sides of a triangle are congruent, then the angles opposite to those sides are congruent.In the triangle ABC it is given the sides AB AC According to isosceles triangle theorem, thenB C"
