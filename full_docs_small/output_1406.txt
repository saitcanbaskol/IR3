"While some palm readers do not place too much importance on the thumb shapes, there are those who do consider it to be an important aspect of assessing someone’s traits and characteristics. They believe that the thumb can reveal a lot of details about an individual’s personality and temperament.As the other fingers on the hand have three distinct phalanges, or sections, the thumb is unique in that it has only two phalanges. However, there are some palmists who consider the Mount of Venus, which resides at the base of the thumb, to be a third phalange.The first phalange, or top, represents one’s will and determination. The second phalange indicates an individual’s ability to use logic and reason. If these two sections are equal in length, the individual will have a balanced amount of logic, energy and drive and the natural ability to obtain goals.If the first phalange is longer than the second one, the individual has more will power than logic. This individual is a hard worker and learns by trial and error. He will eventually carry out his mission, but has a tendency to be a bit overbearing. In most people, the second phalange is longer that the first. This means that the person bases his decision making process more on logic than on will power. He tends to overthink everything and make only small advances, which create obstacles and block the ability to live up to his full potential.If the top phalange or section can be bent backward effortlessly, this is a person that is usually of an easy going nature. If it is somewhat inflexible, than this is a person with a rigid disposition.A large thumb signifies an achiever and a leader. A medium thumb indicates an individual who is an average achiever of success. A short or small thumb reveals a follower, someone who is weak minded, easily deflated and not very determined. A short and club shaped thumb reveals an individual who can be aggressive or insensitive toward others.A strong minded and willful person will most likely have a thumb that reaches the middle joint of the first (index or Jupiter) finger. If it falls quite short of that, this reflects an individual who may have some emotional or mental development issues.The descriptions and characteristics associated with different shapes of the thumb tips (square, conic, spatulate, pointed, flat, hammered, murderer’s) are as follows.Conic — A doer, a quick thinker, shows sensitivity, possesses artistic talents, can have problems with commitments. Sometimes this thumb appears with an indented, waist-like second phalange. People with this type of waistline trait are tactful, polite, kind and discrete.Flat — A double-edged sword individual – at times can be a manipulator or instigator for his own gain or an inspiration to others.Hammered — Large ego, self-centered, hard to please, problems with ambition.Murderer’s or Clubbed — Think of the tip of this thumb as being extremely bulbous. A short fused, reactionary individual, trigger happy, aggressive in nature, unable to think things through before acting out.Pointed — A dreamer, uses intuition, can be controlling, can have difficulty expressing emotions.Spatulate — Inquisitive, nondescript, a follower, capable, can have a tendency to overwork.Square — Realistic, sensible, matter of fact, pragmatic, good sense of right and wrong, regimented, not overly emotional.Another aspect of the thumb that is studied is the angle created between the index finger and the thumb when the hand is facing palm up and relaxed. The angle is known as the angle of generosity and the wider the angle, the more generous the person. An extremely wide angle might indicate a person who is easily taken advantage of. A very narrow angle might signify a person who is greedy or stingy. Most people have an average angle of about 45 degrees.The mobility and flexibility of the thumb is a good indicator of someone’s readiness to accept and adapt to challenges and fluctuations in life. However, if there is too much flexibility of the thumb, this can be a sign that the individual has a tendency to be gullible or easily targeted as a pushover.If the thumb is rigid and stiff, with a tendency to stick or stay close to the side of the palm, this is an indication of one who is careful and wary of matters dealing with money. Some people tend to tuck their thumb into their palm, as if to protect it. This is an indication of someone who might be suffering from social anxieties or some form of mental deficiency.The way the thumb is set on the hand is also analyzed. There are three thumb placements considered: high, middle and low set. A high set thumb indicates someone who is creative, but has a tendency to be resistant to change. Because of that, these individuals may be perceived as being less intelligent than the average person. They can also be cautious and at times quite obstinate. A low-set thumb reveals an individual with a strong independent streak, and one who has a strong sense of moral conviction. A middle-set thumb reveals an individual who is well balanced, honest, forthright, strong-willed and kind.TO LEARN MORE ABOUT PALMISTRY, VISIT THE PALMISTRY ROOM.Click HereClick HereJoin our FB Fan page!Share this:Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)"
