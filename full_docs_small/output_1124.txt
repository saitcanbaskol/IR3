This may occur in an entire lobe of the lung or be scattered throughout both lungs in bronchopneumonia. When the lining (pleura) of the lung becomes affected, the infective process will cause the lung to adhere to the pleura to produce the pain of pleurisy.Read Morethere is still a mild chest/ lung pain in my right lung from a bout of pneumonia last may..doesnt seem like there should be any pain after such a time lapse- is this caused from the scar tissue?

Many people develop wheezing and coughing with these fairly common respiratory infections. M pneumoniae is contagious when it causes these infections. It can spread quickly through a family or other closely-knit group. In most cases, treatment with an antibiotic will keep the infection from spreading.Read MoreThere may be a problem with your lungs, for example chronic bronchitis or a condition called bronchiectasis, or an inherited abnormality such as cystic fibrosis (CF) or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or that you had an atypical pneumonia, one prone to cause tissue destruction.

A second scan six weeks later showed no change in the size of the liason but the radiologist could not say for sure that it was scar tissue. Today I saw a specialist who has recommended a PET scan to finally determine whether or not it is cancer. He said that at first glance it doesn't appear to be cancer and that it is too small to get an absolutely clear biopsy.Read MoreHave you had pneumonia in the past?

I have never heard of this and I am worried sick. I know, of course, it could be lung cancer BUT are there other -not so deadly- reasons this could happen? I had TB as a child (50 years ago and have a small scar) and I get bronchitis and sinus infections frequently. And with this case, I have had a lot of mucus, wheezing and horrific coughing. Can any of this possibly cause a polyp to form?Read MoreI beat it the first time, but it returned as stage 4 metastatic in my lung. I was diagnosed with pneumonia ths week.

He was immediately doing good. He felt alot better and the high heart rate and high BP and high temp returned to normal.

A nodule of this appearance is unlikely to be a scar.Read MoreIn addition to those “pneumonias” that would fall into the categories of interstitial lung disease and those that accompany multisystem diseases is yet another category associated with irreversibly damaged lung tissue  (bronchiectasis) and this in turn may or may not be infectious and when infectious, caused by bacteria related to tuberculosis.Read MoreI don't think it would be from his other surgery, and I don't know why he would have scar tissue on his lung unless he had thoracic surgery before.
