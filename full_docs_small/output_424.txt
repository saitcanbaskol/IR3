It usually forms by contact metamorphism of limestones.Uses of lapis, durability, and simulantsUse of lapis lazuli: beads, cabochons, carvings""Durability"": sensitive to heat, acid, alkalisometimes dyed or coated with waxSwiss Lapis is dyed quartzCommentsThe name lapis is Persian for blue.Prior to 1828, it was used as pigment for ultramarine paint.For more that 6000 years, it has also been used as an ancient precious stone/gem in Afghanistan, and traded throughout Africa and Europe.Other commentsSee a movie on a lapis (sodalite) structure!"
