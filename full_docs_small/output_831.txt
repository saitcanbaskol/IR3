(Was born on may 23rd)in Japan, is a character in Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory, and is the CPU of Planeptune in a 1980s-parallel universe.Her nickname is ""Pururun"" (""Plutie"" in the English Version) and she's known for her gentle appearance, although she is quite difficult to read.Contents [ show]Personality EditPlutia EditPlutia has a very gentle appearance, and does not seem to be a bad person or naughty. However, she is usually skipping out on her Goddess duties, much like how Neptune would if given the chance to go and have fun instead. Considering she is seen holding a Neptune doll, she may very much like Neptune. One of her special attacks show her stomping on this doll (with a voodoo doll effect on enemies), so she may have a minor (compared to Iris Heart's) sadistic streak. She values friendship, and takes it very seriously.Iris Heart EditPlutia's goddess form, while she actually retains her carefree voice, unlike most others whose voice does change, her characteristics change instead. She becomes very sadistic and cold, causing trauma for everybody, friend or foe alike, however she seems to direct such insults to villains to damage their ego while driving her allies to do better through enraging them. Due to this extreme sadistic streak , Neptune refers to this form as ""Sadie"", a play on the word ""Sadist"" and her nickname ""Plutie"". This tendency is revealed in one of her special attacks, where she stomps on the enemy, and the players are treated to a first person view of the monster first. She also likes to torment people and hates people who lie to her and ruin her fun.Appearance EditPlutia has small similarities in terms of design to Neptune herself. But whether she has a personal connection or not is unknown. She looks to be pre-teen, but may very well be an adult or close to one in terms of age. She has fair-pale skin and bright pink eyes. Her hair is about waist length with very wild, messy bangs framing her face while her hair looks to be worn down, but in a very thick/big braid held with a pastel pink frilled ribbon.She wears an odd outfit, consisting of a very loose powder blue top with a frilled neck segment with a bright pink-purple bow and a long white segment in the center held with a white multi-piece belt with a purple piece in the center. At the top on the sleeve sides are pink cloth segments with ruffled white lining and a single white stripe on each piece. Her dress has small sleeves with button-clasp, making it look like a shirt pair of overalls. On each sleeve is a peach and white line, while the sleeves cuff buttons to the upper segment of sleeve, most likely to keep them from being too long. She also wears an uneven length white skirt piece that looks longer in back, and opened in the middle. Under her skirt, she wears white panties with a pink bear printed on the back. Along with pink and white striped socks and pink bear shaped fuzzy slippers. She looks dressed for bedtime.As Iris Heart, Plutia's hair becomes a darker, purple color and lengthens somewhat as it's pulled out of its braid. Her bangs remain the same, though longer and tend to cover her eyes easily. Her eyes seem to be the same shade of pink but are much more squinted. She wears a black HDD outfit with pink accessories. Consisting of a tank top like bustier piece with very thin straps and button-like pieces with multiple holes in the center, a neck piece with a glowing line and pink line below it, small straps connecting to her bikini bottom piece, almost shoulder length gloves with multiple pink pieces, and long boot like parts connecting to the outfit by the outer piece. She also has on pink and black thin earrings.Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory EditEditChapter 3 EditIn the beginning of the third chapter, Noire whines and complains about how Lowee is copying Lastation in terms of tech. This annoys Plutia so much that she gets angry. Histoire points this out to Noire, who was the one who constantly reminds Neptune not to make her angry and realizes she has dug her own grave. She transforms into Iris Heart and demands Neptune and Histoire to leave while she has a ""chat"" with Noire. After two hours Plutia comes out of the room feeling refreshed. Noire, however, was broken.Hyperdimension Neptunia the Animation EditEpisode 6 events:She falls out of the sky and says she's Planeptune's CPU, making it her first appearance in the anime.Megadimension Neptunia VII EditDespite not making her physical appearance in this installment, she is briefly mentioned by Nepgear and older Neptune in one conversation in Zero Dimension G story arc.Also makes an appearance as a scout obtained via DLC.Weapons and Abilities EditPlutia wields a doll in her human form and a broad bladed katana in her HDD form. Her powers seem to revolve around the use of lightning and her signature move; Fighting Viper, is a good example of it. Her Final Form CPU transforms her into a stealth wing which apparently possesses the power to destroy the world (With Neptune's help). Fortunately that is just a battle effect/dramatization (we hope).Stat wise, Plutia is magic oriented, having abnormally high INT. Her best skills are Rush oriented magic damage attacks, and she has no skills based on her STR. VIT, MEN and MOV are where she suffers, having some of the lower tier defenses in the game. She does make this up by having access to healing skills and buffs to her magic.sikiş EditAs Plutia Edit""Ooh, you're still alive. Um, are you... umm... okay?""""No, I'm telling you the truth. I would never tell a lie..""Uh-oh... I did it again.""""But if this many monsters are around, we can't have a picnic...""""Peer-at-you? Aw, that's not a cute name at all...""

The reason is unknown as to why they share this trait. They also share the trait of their personalities drastically altering whenever they transform into their Goddess forms.Plutia uses a doll for her weapon, which she animates with her magic. This is a reference to Pamela Ibis from the Atelier series.Plutia calls Neptune ""Neppy"" and Blanc ""Blanny"", while she is called ""Plutie"" by Neptune. Curiously, she consistently calls Nepgear ""Neppy. Jr"" in either her CPU or human form, whereas she will refer to her other friends by their proper names when she transforms into Iris Heart (That only goes for the English version).Plutia is one of only two CPU characters whose attack skills are different between Human and HDD forms, the other being Peashy .Plutia is named after a console prototype which has never been released from SEGA called the SEGA Pluto. This system was to be an upgrade to the already released SEGA Saturn which had an internet connection built into the system.  [1]  [2]  [3]Despite this though, Plutia is based on the SEGA Mega Drive  (Genesis in North America). This is reflected in Iris Heart's design with her choker resembling the top of the system's first model.Plutia's sadism is a reference to how aggressive SEGA was to Nintendo after releasing the Genesis.In addition, the scene where Iris Heart ""plays"" with Arfoire is also a nod to SEGA's hostile attitude toward piracy.In the anime, Iris Heart uses a Whip Sword, very similar to Ivy's sword from Soul Calibur, as seen in Episode 9 when she prevents Rei from running away. In the game, however, the sword appears to be a regular sword.Both she and Syrma from Mugen Souls Z have a similar personality and share the same English voice actor.In the Battle, Plutia is useful for INT stats and increasing everyone's INT status.Gallery EditAs Iris Heart As Plutia As Iris HeartPlutia's roomFor official images of Plutia see Plutia (images).
