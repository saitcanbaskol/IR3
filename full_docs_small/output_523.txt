What makes the swing such a great abdominal exercise is the fact that you are working your abs the way they were meant to be, stabilizing them not flexing them.With the swing you are getting a lot more than a killer abs workout. It’s also a great way to burn that stubborn belly fat, and the swing works your entire body, in particular, the butt, hamstrings and low back.To get an in-depth instruction on how to do the kettlebell swing and see why it is such a great abdominal exercise I suggest you take a look at the video below.

For this one, you want to…brace your abssqueeze your glutes, do so throughout the entire exercisetake the kettlebell behind your back, switch hands and bring the KB around front, handing off to the other hand in a continuous motion.As with all the other kb exercises it’s important to keep a nice flat back. Go as fast as you can that enables you to maintain an upright torso. Don’t alternate directions, finish your reps for one side before switching direction. The around the world is an anti rotation exercise which hits those abs hard.Kettlebell Renegade RowsThe Kettlebell Renegade Row is another excellent anti rotation abdominal exercise that looks simple but hits those abs like you wouldn’t believe. Many people pass on the renegade row thinking it is an upper body back exercise, which isn’t totally off base. However, the weight you can handel on this exercise doesn’t make it you most effective back exercise. The real work comes when you lift an arm altering your base of support. This forces your abs have to work extra hard making sure your torso doesn’t twist and rotate, your abs and glutes will have to be nice and tight if that is going to happen.To make it a little easier you can widen your feet. Narrowing your base of support will make the exercise that much more difficult and you will see why it’s one of the best core exercises.The Kettlebell HaloThe kettlebell Halo exercise rounds out the best top 5 abdominal exercises you can do with a kettlebell. Just like the other core exercises the kb Halo looks simple but is deceptively difficult and makes for a challenging ab workout.How To Do The KB HaloStart by holding the KB upside down with both hands at chest height bring it back behind and around your head and back to the start.Once the KB is in front, switch and go the opposite way.Do not move anything but your arms and shoulders.Those are the 5 best kettlebell exercises for training your abdominals that you can do at home, in a small space without ever having to do another single crunch again.You don’t have to do a kettlebell workout to to include these into your abs workout.
