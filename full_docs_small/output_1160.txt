"Lululemon Fabric Guide and TipsThe vast majority of products at any given time will fall into a couple of categories…The luon familyLuon is billed as lulu’s champion yoga fabric. Luon is generally a nylon/spandex blend. It has a cottony feel to it and can feel somewhat heavier than other athletic fabrics. All luon is 4-way stretch and moisture-wicking. Variations of luon include full-on luon, which is a tighter weave intended to address the issue of sheerness–the jury is out whether it actually solved this problem. Light luon (sometimes called luon light) is exactly what it sounds like: slightly less thick, which is great for things like tank tops. Finally, there is seriously light luon, which is basically sheer.Some luon blends include polyester in the mix along with nylon and spandex, and still others are actually only polyester/spandex without any nylon at all. Polyester is generally used for printed designs, because nylon fabric does not accept patterns as well as polyester. That said, printed polyester luon has a decidedly different feel to them than the solid colors made of nylon. Polyester luon feels much slicker and less cottony-soft. It also tends to get a whitened look when stretched. Unfortunately, a lot of luon prints can be see-through, so be sure you check the rear view before you head to the cash register.Luon is a versatile fabric which can be used for a whole slew of activities, including just lounging around. Most runners don’t like to run in luon bottoms, because it can feel hotter. Luon is not generally recommended for high-intensity, high-friction activities like running or spinning because it is more likely to pill.The luxtreme familyLuxtreme is lulu’s signature fabric for running. It has a much lighter feel than luon and feels nothing like cotton. Instead, it’s smooth-faced and slick to the touch. Luxtreme is highly resistant to friction and will not pill. Personally, I feel it is more breathable than luon but that could be simply because it’s lighter weight. Luxtreme is another versatile fabric that can be used for lots of other activities such as cycling, weightlifting, crosstraining/CrossFit, or general gym-going. It’s also great for hot yoga.Full-on luxtreme is a variation of luxtreme: basically, it’s two layers of luxtreme bonded together. This means the fabric has a slightly thicker feel than regular luxtreme, plus offers fantastic coverage in the bum and really holds you in.Side note: One reason I really look luxtreme is because pet hair brushes right off of it! Luon, on the other hand, is basically a magnet for pet hair and lint.The nulu familyThe newest fabric to lululemon’s lineup, this fabric is designed specifically to be ultra-lightweight. It’s softer than luxtreme but not cottony like luon. It’s like a hybrid of the two in terms of feel.Nulu is extremely breathable because it’s so lightweight, making it a great option for hot climates and hot workouts. It’s important to note that it does not offer any compression or smoothing. If you prefer a firmer fit that holds you in, skip nulu and go with either luon or luxtreme instead.Nulu is best for low-impact activities like studio workouts. Nulux is an even newer variation that’s designed for higher impact sports while still maintaining that lightweight feeling.Other notable fabricsCotton (or cotton fleece) is used in some to-and-from or casual items, most notably in the Scuba hoodie. Some yoga/casual crossover tops will be made in a lightweight cotton. Pima cotton is a softer, thinner cotton used in a lot of casual tees.Rulu is short for “running luon” and is perhaps the most decadent lulu fabric out there. Its intent is winter running, so it is thick and incredibly soft. These items typically only come out in the fall and winter, because they are much too hot for summer. Rulu is one of the most comfortable fabrics for wearing as casual wear, too.Silverescent is sometimes added to high-sweat items such as swiftlies. It is silver fibers woven into the fabric that helps prevent the growth of bacteria, which helps prevent the fabric from becoming stinky so fast.Swift fabric is used primarily in speed shorts, groovy run shorts, pace setter skirts, and studio pants/crops/jackets. It’s designed to be very lightweight and has a much more smooth and crisp feel than any other fabrics listed here, more or less like wind pants.Liners, overlays, and insets are generally made of something like mesh or coolmax.Caring for lululemon fabricsAll workout styles should be washed cold water and hung up to dry. Be sure not to use fabric softener, because it will damage the fabric’s ability to wick away sweat as well as make it less breathable.Be sure not to tumble dry your lulu. Heat damages stretchy fabrics like lulu. Washing cold and skipping the dryer means your lulu will last longer.For cotton fabrics such as scuba hoodies, you should still wash cold, but you can tumble dry them on low heat.Be sure you wash similar fabrics together. Wash all your workout clothes together and wash all your cotton and other natural fabrics in their own loads. Washing workout fabrics with cotton can cause them to pill.For down and synthetic puffer jackets, care is a little more complicated. I wrote detailed instructions on how to wash them here.Where to go nextI’ve got a guide on how to choose the best activewear fabric for you.
