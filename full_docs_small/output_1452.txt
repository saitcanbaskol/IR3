"Stress Corrosion CrackingStress corrosion cracking (SCC)  is caused by the simultaneous effects of tensile stress and a specific  corrosive environment. Stresses may be due to applied loads, residual  stresses from the manufacturing process, or a combination of both.Cross sections of SCC  frequently show branched cracks. This river branching pattern is unique  to SCC and is used in failure analysis to identify when this form of  corrosion has occurred.The photo below shows SCC of  an insulated stainless-steel condensate line. Water wetted the  insulation and caused chlorides to leach from the insulation onto the  hot metal surface. This is a common problem on steam and condensate  lines. Control is by maintaining the jackets around the lines so that  moisture doesn't enter the insulation or is quickly drained off.The next two photos show  intergranular SCC of an aluminum aerospace part. The intergranular  nature of the corrosion can be seen in the scanning electron microscope  image on the left and in the microscopic cross section on the right. The  arrows indicate the primary crack shown in both pictures. Note that  secondary cracks are also apparent. These secondary cracks are common in  stress corrosion cracking.The failure above occurred on  an aluminum alloy subjected to residual stresses and salt water. Changes  in alloy heat treatment recommended by KSC  Materials Laboratory eliminated this problem. McDanels, S.

Flexible tubing was used to connect faucets to  the fixed metal piping. The picture below shows stress corrosion  cracking after eight years in this service. The tubing was bent and  stress cracks started at the outside tensile side of the tube. Flexible  plastic piping is now used less often in this service-especially for  hot water service.
