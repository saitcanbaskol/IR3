The day, twilights (civil, nautical, and astronomical), and night are indicated by the color bands from yellow to gray. The transitions to and from daylight saving time are indicated by the 'DST' labels.HumidityWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.The chance that a given day will be muggy in New York City is essentially constant during March, remaining around 0% throughout.For reference, on August 2, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 54% of the time, while on December 15, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.Humidity Comfort Levels in MarchThe percentage of time spent at various humidity comfort levels, categorized by dew point: dry < 55°F < comfortable < 60°F < humid < 65°F < muggy < 70°F < oppressive < 75°F < miserable.WindThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.The average hourly wind speed in New York City is gradually decreasing during March, decreasing from 10.2 miles per hour to 9.3 miles per hour over the course of the month.For reference, on February 26, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 10.3 miles per hour, while on August 1, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 6.2 miles per hour.Average Wind Speed in MarchThe average of mean hourly wind speeds (dark gray line), with 25th to 75th and 10th to 90th percentile bands. The wind direction in New York City during March is predominantly out of the west from March 1 to March 14 and from March 21 to March 31 and the north from March 14 to March 21.Wind Direction in MarchThe percentage of hours in which the mean wind direction is from each of the four cardinal wind directions (north, east, south, and west), excluding hours in which the mean wind speed is less than 1 mph. The lightly tinted areas at the boundaries are the percentage of hours spent in the implied intermediate directions (northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest).Water TemperatureNew York City is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake).

Kennedy International Airport  (15%, 22 kilometers, east).Other DataAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Tables of the Sun, Moon and Planets, by Jean Meeus.All other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis. This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.Land Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database, published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.Elevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Names, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database.Time zones for aiports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com.Maps are © Esri, with data from National Geographic, Esri, DeLorme, NAVTEQ, UNEP-WCMC, USGS, NASA, ESA, METI, NRCAN, GEBCO, NOAA, and iPC.DisclaimerThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose.

While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.We further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader."
