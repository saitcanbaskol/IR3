"Approach ConsiderationsIf a congruent reduction cannot be achieved or if the dorsal instability is unstable in 30Â° of supination, then arthroscopic evaluation of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is recommended with repair as needed.Repairing TFCC tears is contraindicated in the presence of infection or degeneration. Palmer class 2 degenerative TFCC tears (see Overview, Pathophysiology) represent a pathologic progression of disease associated with ulnar impaction syndrome.Degeneration of the TFCC is found with repetitive pronation and axial grip loading in association with positive ulnar variance and impaction between the ulnar head and the proximal pole of the lunate. Treatment of degenerative TFCC tears associated with ulnar impaction syndrome consists of nonoperative treatment first with immobilization, avoidance of aggravating activities, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).Palmer class 2A and 2B lesions that fail to respond to conservative treatment are treated with gentle debridement. If the patient is ulnar-positive and symptomatic, a formal ulnar shortening is considered. An arthroscopic wafer is contraindicated, in that this would require resection of intact TFCC to perform the procedure or require performing the procedure entirely through the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) portals.The surgical indications for an arthroscopic wafer procedure are a Palmer class 2C or 2D lesion in a positive ulnar variance of not more than 2 mm without evidence of lunate-triquetrum instability. If lunate-triquetrum instability is present, this is addressed with formal ulnar shortening in an attempt to tighten the ulnocarpal ligaments and decrease the motion between the lunate and triquetrum.For patients with a positive ulnar variance of more than 2 mm, formal ulnar shortening is performed. For patients with neutral or negative ulnar variance and a Palmer class 2C lesion, an arthroscopic debridement is performed. Palmer class 2E lesions respond unpredictably to arthroscopic debridement. They are usually treated with a salvage procedure such as a limited ulnar head resection, a Sauve-Kapandji procedure, or a Darrach procedure that addresses the DRUJ and lunotriquetral (LT) joint pathology.Next: Medical Therapy"
