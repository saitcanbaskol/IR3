"White hard pimple on scrotum sac - what is it?Foonj May 17, 2017My scrotum has come up with a single spot. Hard white oversized pimple. If I squeeze it nothing, it's not itchy but it is sensitive to touch when I scratch my scrotum. I put a needle into it and squeezed it and nothing came out, i puppy the top layer of skin off ( like you would a pimple and squeezed and blot simply went though it like it was a normal patch of skin. Unsure if I should be worried about it?

Second, I would see a dermatologist, he/she will be able to properly diagnose what the issue may be.CommentHave an Answer?Notify me of new activity on this questionJoin this community"
