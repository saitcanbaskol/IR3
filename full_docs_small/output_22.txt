This is learnt in a Chinese martial art called Dim Mak based on acupuncture pressure points, but this art is very restricted and needs and understanding of Chinese acupuncture points. Because of this, this article can only provide information on on fragile areas that we'll call vulnerable points. This is used to exploit a weakness or vulnerability in the human body to gain an advantage over an opponent. When using these pressure points one must be particularly careful as it is easy to kill someone accidentally, such as a friend or even an enemy. At that point, you enter the legal system, which generally does not know if you were really defending yourself or were actually the aggressor, and in some cases, that may not even matter. This leads to the point that, more important than the technique, is the mindset that you use in training, which is, of course a personal philosophical decision, but one which requires much thought and consideration of when what you practice must be put to use."
