"Social Science EconomicsWhat type of economic system does america have? and why?Follow 7 answersAnswersRelevanceRatingNewestOldestBest Answer: By ""America"" I assume you mean United States. Most people in USA seem to think that it has a pure capitalist economy. No it hasn't. Between 25% and 30% of all employment, production and consumption decisions in USA are determined by government orders and invoices. So the government is deciding the employment, payment, work schedules and use of raw-materials in about 27% of all industry and service industries. This includes the military; infrastructure such as road and rail; public administration at federal, state and city levels; public-sector provision such as health, education, caring, policing, safety and rescue services;and so on. Total public expenditure in these categories was $5 trillion in 2011; against a GNP of about $16 trillion. So the USA is a mixed economy, very much like UK, Germany and Scandinavian countries, Japan and Canada. And over the past 25 years, since Reagan's time, this proportion of public expenditure has risen continuously. The Obama administration seems content to let it rise further. If current USA public policy proposals come to fruition, the government's share of economic activity will rise to about 35% of all income, expenditure and employment. This will be about the same proportion as existed under National Socialism in Germany 1933-45. And it is only a little less than the proportion in the Russian Federation [estimated 39%] since 2005.Source (s):http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/http://www.forecast-chart.com/chart-us-g...Diapason45 · 5 years ago1 0 CommentThe two main extreme types of economic system are Capitalism, where resources are directed by market forces, and a Planned Economy where resources are directed by the state/government. The USA has a Mixed Economy, somewhere in the middle between a capitalist system and a planned economy. It relies a great deal on markets to direct resources, but almost all markets are heavily restricted by various rules and regulations set out by the state and federal governments. Additionally, the US has a large public sector economy (defence, education, 'public services') in which the government exerts more direct control over a large proportion of the economy's resources. Why does it have this system? Because it is sensible enough to recognise that an extreme capitalist economy and an entirely planned economy would both be a nightmare to live in. An extreme capitalist economy would probably be a brutal economy which would give most people little protection from being exploited by the rich and powerful. A planned economy, with economic decisions being dictated by an all-powerful state, would probably leave us with very few of our fundamental freedoms.Source (s):http://imos.org.uk/Robert Jameson · 5 years ago1 1 CommentI think a mixed economy where Capitalism is regulated is the most compatible economy. Don't believe anyone who says they can defend Capitalism through the bible, because using the same means, I could defend socialism with twice as much scriptural evidence. However, I don't think the bible really addresses this issue directly. Most American christians want a pure free-market system, and would like to destroy whatever is left of our mixed-economy. So they have embarked, quite successfully at privatizing much of what the Government used to do, and have managed to deregulate many industries. Of course, we are seeing the results of this sort of thinking in today's financial troubles (funny how they are now even wanting to bail out these companies - a true free-market believer would let failing companies fail, however this would probably mean another Great Depression for the US - and would expose the fallacies of the pure free-market folks). I think many American christians idolize the free-market system, almost having a certain faith in it (as it requires faith). I suggest reading The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein - the book will enlighten anyone as to the pitfalls of this sort of thinking, and reveals all the damage that these folks have caused. Well, for all its worth, those are my thoughts.Kimberly · 2 years ago0 0 CommentFascist. A fascist economy is where the government is presumed to know best how economic activity should be run, on what conditions, to serve the higher goals of ""society"". Your rights are considered to be whatever the government says they are. Your right to property is considered to be whatever is left over after the government has unilaterally decided to take as much as it wants and spend it on anything it feels like. The government is presumed to have superior knowledge and competence to supply primary education, secondary education, tertiary education, the roads, the bridges, medical services, water, air, soil, food quality, security, justice, money, credit, banking, pharmaceuticals, professions. In fact government is considered to have superior competence to decide everything, without exception. The fact that this is explicitly illegal under the Constitution is considered to be a laughable objection. The government is presumed to represent every important social value in priority to what any individual might think or value. Production takes place by the government licensing production. In law, a license is permission to do something that would otherwise be illegal. Although in theory, in a free country, you are free to do anything unless it's illegal, in practice, all productive activity is illegal without government permission. Try this quick quiz: name any productive activity in America that is legal, without you first getting some kind of permit, certificate, or license from some level or office of government. You will find there's hardly anything. Fascism is a species of the genus socialism. It's national socialism. It works by the government taking wealth from the owners and producers, and handing it out to their pet political favourites, such as big banks, big corporations, and the military-industrial complex. Google ""Hitler economic policies"" and I challenge you to find *any* that mainstream Democrats and Republicans disagree with.Sienna · 5 years ago2 0 CommentAmerica's economic system is based on the principles of monopoly: 1--Never give anything away for nothing. 2--Never give more than you have to give  (always catch the buyer hungry and always make him wait). 3--Always take everything back if you possibly can. America has this system because it the closest to nature on the planet. Nature doesn't have 'socialism'. Nature is a spider ripping the entrails from a moth. Nature is a plant evolving a poison to keep itself from being eaten.Andrew Jackson · 5 years ago0 1 CommentThe US has a.......
