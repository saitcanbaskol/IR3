Using blaze powder, the next step is to add a primary ingredient to create a base potion, which is usually nether wart, which creates an awkward potion and has no effects. By brewing a second ingredient into a base potion in the same manner, you can create a potion with a working effect. A third ingredient may be added to make the effect more intense or last longer, or turn the effect harmful. Gunpowder can be added to a potion at any stage to convert it to a splash potion, which can be thrown (or fired using a dispenser) to disperse its effect in a radius. Finally, dragon's breath can be added to a splash potion to convert it to a lingering potion, which can be used to disperse its effect in a bubble. Each brewing step takes 20 seconds.Each blaze powder used provides fuel for 20 brewing operations. Fuel is consumed when a brewing operation starts; it is not recovered if the operation is halted prematurely by removing the ingredient or potion bottles.Video  [ edit]Note: The left video is outdated; it does not mention the potions of Invisibility, Leaping, Night Vision or Water Breathing or their ingredients. Also the brewing stand now requires Blaze Powder in the computer and console editions.Minecraft Gameplay Mechanics: BrewingYour browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available.

Nether Wart is the primary ingredient added to water bottles at this stage, as it is required to make most of the potions. Fermented Spider Eye allows making a Potion of Weakness. All other base ingredients do not allow making anything useful.Name Icon When added makesNether WartAwkward PotionGlowstone DustThick PotionRedstoneMundane PotionFermented Spider EyePotion of WeaknessSecondary Ingredients  [ edit]Secondary ingredients imbue an awkward potion with a particular effect but do not alter potion duration or intensity.

Instead of seeing at maximum brightness, you turn invisible.Splash and Lingering potions: Any potion can be turned into a splash potion, and subsequently, a lingering potion. Splash potions and lingering potions can be modified in exactly the same manner as their normal counterparts. For instance, a splash water bottle can be brewed into any of the primary potions, though the result will remain a splash potion.Potions  [ edit]Main article: PotionsPrimary  [ edit]All primary potions are created by brewing a single ingredient with a water bottle.Potion Base Reagent Effect Precursor toAwkward Potion Water BottleNether WartNone Potion of Healing Potion of Fire Resistance Potion of Poison Potion of Regeneration Potion of Strength Potion of Swiftness Potion of Night Vision Potion of Water Breathing Potion of Leaping Potion of the Turtle Master  [ upcoming 1.13] Potion of Slow Falling  [ upcoming 1.13]Mundane Potion Water BottleRedstone,Ghast Tear,Glistering Melon,Blaze Powder,Magma Cream,Sugar,Spider Eye,orRabbit's FootNone NoneThick Potion Water BottleGlowstone DustNone NonePotion of Weakness Water BottleFermented Spider EyeReduces all melee attacks by 4 () damage.

The brewing system was originally meant to be procedural, meaning that the recipes were meant to be different each time one generated a Minecraft world.  [1]1.0.0Beta 1.9-pre2Initially, the cauldron was where potions were brewed, though cauldrons were not assigned a block ID, rendering potions unobtainable except through modding the cauldron so that it would be obtainable. When the cauldron was obtained, potions could be brewed by adding water to the cauldron followed by certain ingredients. Correctly combined ingredients would confer purely beneficial potion effects, and incorrect combinations added negative effects. The system was complicated, lacked a GUI, and formed many duplicate potions (i.e. two potions that were exactly the same could be made in several different ways), so Notch and Jeb came up with a new brewing method using a brewing stand.  [2]Beta 1.9-pre3A brewing GUI was added and most duplicate potions were removed (the total possible potions went down from 150 combinations to only 25 different potions in 31 combinations). Some status effects available in earlier 1.9 pre-releases as potions became inaccessible (e.g. Nausea, Blindness and Invisibility).Beta 1.9-pre4Throwable splash potions introduced – brewed by placing gunpowder and any potion together in a brewing stand.Glistering melon was added to be the ingredient for the Potion of Healing, until this point conferred by the ghast tear, which was itself changed to create the Potion of Regeneration instead.Converted certain ingredients into base-secondary ingredients (the spider eye, glistering melon and blaze powder made Mundane Potion when brewed into a water bottle in addition to their previous functions), bringing the potion total to 28 different potions in 35 combinations.1.1 12w01a The time to brew potions was decreased to 20 seconds.1.4.2 12w34aBrewing recipes for Potions of Night Vision and Invisibility added: Potion of Night Vision is brewed by adding a golden carrot to an Awkward Potion. Potion of Invisibility is brewed by adding a fermented spider eye to a Potion of Night Vision.1.5 13w01aHoppers added, which can place and take items in and out from brewing stands.1.7.2 13w36aPotions of Water Breathing added; they can be brewed by adding a pufferfish to an Awkward Potion.1.8 14w27aAdded Potion of Leaping; it is brewed by adding a rabbit's foot to an Awkward Potion.1.8.1 1.8.1-pre1The potion of leaping can now be extended using redstone.1.915w31aGlowstone and redstone can no longer be added to extended potions, and redstone can no longer be added to tier-II potions.Potions of Weakness can no longer be made using a thick potion, mundane potion, awkward potion, potion of Regeneration, or potion of Strength.Potions of Slowness can no longer be made using a potion of Fire Resistance.Potions of Harming can no longer be made using a potion of Water Breathing.Removed reverted potions, see removed features for more information on them.Splash potions can now be created from all potions, including water bottles.15w33a Added lingering potions.15w42a Blaze powder is now required as fuel for brewing.15w43a Blaze powder as fuel reduced from 30 points to 20.Upcoming1.1318w07aAdded the potion of the Turtle Master, brewable with turtle shells as well as its 3:00 and level II variants.18w14a Added potion of Slow Falling, and its extended variant.Pocket Edition Alpha0.12.1 build 1 Added potions and brewing.Pocket Edition1.0 build 1 Added lingering potions.Bedrock Edition1.2 build 1 Blaze powder is now required as fuel for brewing.Legacy Console EditionTU7CU11.0Patch 1Added potions and brewing.TU14 1.04 Added Night Vision and Invisibility Potions.TU46 CU36 1.38 Patch 15Added lingering potions.Blaze powder is now required as fuel for brewing.Potion type history  [ edit]Based on information found in minecraft.jar/lang/en_US.lang, the current potion types are listed below:Potion of SwiftnessPotion of SlownessPotion of StrengthPotion of WeaknessPotion of HealingPotion of HarmingPotion of RegenerationPotion of Fire ResistancePotion of Water BreathingPotion of PoisonPotion of Night VisionPotion of InvisibilityPotion of LeapingDue to changes in the brewing system, the following potions are currently not accessible:Potion of HastePotion of DullnessPotion of NauseaPotion of BlindnessPotion of HungerPotion of DecayPotion of ResistanceSome potions also do not have a real name in minecraft (i.e. Potion of potion.healthBoost.postFix) and are currently not accessiblePotion of potion.healthBoost.postFixPotion of potion.absorption.postFixPotion of potion.saturation.postFixTrivia  [ edit]Splash potion brewed using gunpowder.As long as at least one of the three bottom spaces is filled, the brewing will continue, and additional bottles of water or potion can be added. However, if the ingredient is removed, or the bottom 3 slots are emptied at any time during the process, the process will stop and nothing will have been brewed.The three potions do not necessarily have to be the same.Upgrading the effect of a potion that has no time parameter (i.e. Instant Health, Harming) with glowstone dust has no downsides.Upgrading the time of a potion that has no level II effect (i.e. Fire Resistance, Slowness, Weakness) with redstone has no downsides.Although Jeb said that in the 1.9 pre-release 3 there were 161 possible different potion combinations with 2,653 in the future, in the actual third pre-release only 22 different potions could be made without the use of external programs. Of those, 19 potions had one of 8 different effects.There are many Potions that were left behind from 1.9 pre-releases that fill up different metadatas that otherwise cannot be brewed or obtained without a SMP server command or inventory editor. These potions include but are not limited to: Bungling Potion, Buttering Potion, Debonair Potion, Refined Potion.More water can be taken to the Nether in one trip by filling water buckets, carrying a stack of glass bottles, and using a cauldron. This is because stackable glass bottles do not stack once they have been filled with water.Undead mobs (zombies, skeletons, zombie pigmen, and Withers) are unaffected by splash potions of poison and regeneration, take damage from instant health splash potions, and gain health from instant damage.Mixing Fermented Spider Eye with any base potion (including the ones that were left behind) will either result in a Potion of Weakness, a Potion of Invisibility, or a Potion of Slowness. The Potions of Slowness and Invisibility can only be brewed from the base potions that were left behind.By modifying the item NBT using an editor or commands, it is possible to get a potion that cannot be upgraded into a splash potion.Combining Night Vision and Water Breathing will give you the best visibility underwater.Gallery  [ edit]Texture file for the 1.9 brewing user interfaceSee also  [ edit]CraftingEnchantingSmeltingNotes  [ edit]↑ a b c Stacks with regeneration from having a full or mostly full ;Food Bar.References  [ edit]↑ “The Mundane Potion is a remnant of an abandoned procedural brewing system - meaning that the recipes were meant to be different each time you generated a Minecraft world.
