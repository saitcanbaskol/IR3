Integrity Toys revealed the third exclusive WClub doll to its club members and she is a humdinger!! There is absolutely nothing about this doll that I am not in love with. She has a dark auburn updo and cream skin tone ( used previously on Elise). She is on an FR2 body and has hand applied lashes. BEEEEautiful!PurityDasha™2013 W Club FR2™ Exclusive Dressed DollLimited Edition Size: TBASpecial W Club Suggested Retail Price: $135.00Estimated Shipping Date: Approximately Late Fall 2013**Photos are property of Integrity Toys, Inc.**Holy cow!! The updo alone on this mahogany haired beauty is enough to open up the pocket book but the dress…oh my the dress. This is so sculpted and refined…so unbelievably chic and fabulous. AND…let us take a moment to look at the amazing price! Since its inception, FR2 has not gone below $150 for a dressed doll. Not only does Integrity offer up this stunning bit of loveliness but they dropped the price.Winner, Winner Chicken Dinner!!!!AdvertisementsJune 1, 2013 | Categories: Dasha, Fashion Royalty, FR2 | Tags: Fashion Royalty Squared, FR2, FR2 Purity Dasha, Integrity Toys, Integrity Toys 2013, Purity Dasha, WClub 2013, WClub exclusive 2013 | 10 CommentsDark Swan Elise dons a day suitNow try to say the title of this post five times quickly {snort}. I almost made the title “To my props…How do I love thee, let me count the ways.” I seem to be using these busts quite a bit but oh well. People often ask me about the lighting I use in my photos and I thought it would be fun to show these photos because the shots that came out the best ( In my opinion, and that of my partner in crime and in house tech support…the husband) are actually the ones that used the least light. They used the least number of photography lights but were placed in such a way as to add drama and texture to the shot. I am forever changing lights around as I shoot something because I want to see what else I can get to come out on film. I love how the low lighting shows off the angles on the face of this Elise. I will also admit to adding some vignetting on the full length shot.Model: FR2 Dark Swan EliseSuit and Purse: Fashion Royalty Foreign AffairShoes: FR2 shoe pack from 2011 FR conventionHat: I could tell you but you wouldn’t believe meOkay so hat is really a scrapbook embellishment.April 28, 2012 | Categories: Elise Jolie, Fashion Royalty, Uncategorized | Tags: Dark Swan Elise Jolie, Doll Photography, Fashion Royalty Foreign affair, Fashion Royalty Squared, Rebecca Berry Photography | 12 CommentsIntegrity Toys 2012 Reveal….the aftermathWell, a week has gone by and those in the Fashion Royalty collecting world are still absorbing the massive amount of new eye candy that was displayed at the Integrity Toys webinar. I think it is safe to say that Integrity blew many collectors socks off with their new offerings for 2012. Evidence of that is clear…dealers have sold out preorders on many products already. Another factor in the early sold out status this year were lower edition sizes and smaller allotments to a growing number of dealers. This resulted in many collectors being told “ sorry, we are sold out of the doll you ordered.” Very frustrating! I would imagine it is a tough road to walk for Integrity and its dealers. A business would want to keep edition sizes low to decrease excessive inventory for their dealers while helping to maintain value for their customers. It’s that low supply/ high demand economics 101 again. A business also has to satisfy its customer and it would appear that many of Integrity’s loyal customers were left wanting in this last round of preorders. Finding the right edition size is not an exact science and I do believe there is something to be said for leaving your customers always wanting for more….but you don’t want to starve them right? I just can’t help but wonder if perhaps they guessed a little low with their numbers this time around. I managed to procure everything that I wanted through my amazing dealer ( Love ya Barb!)…but I really feel for those who were not able to get what they wanted and I feel for the dealers who had to disappoint many of their loyal customers because they simply did not have the allotments to satisfy demand. Where is the happy medium??Yes Integrity…you have that good of a collection for 2012….hope you have not lost some collectors with the stingy edition sizes this year.Here were my favorites for this latest 2012 reveal.I am not saying I ordered all of these….but I’m not saying I didn’t eitherThe Kyori gift set was the definite winner if current doll board feedback and the speed with which it sold out is any indication.Some other early preorder sellouts were the Nu.Face Lillith and Eden gift set and Giselle, Fashion Royalty’s Adele and FR2’s Tatyana. The Mod Poppy Parker line sold out on preorders in …I swear….nano seconds.After a new collection comes out, I always find it fascinating to research and see comments from others on fashions that may have inspired the collection designs. Obviously Jason Wu’s designs will be an inspiration but I am pleased to see that other designers works are favored as well. I wish I could take credit for the sleuthing on these and finding all of them but I cannot. I found a number of these from the very observant and talented members of the WClub forum.First up is Kyori pictured above….it looks like the skirt portion of her evening gown was inspired by Zac Posen’s Spring 2012 RTWAnother of Zac Posen’s designs may have inspired FR2’s Ayumi as well…The collection Adele may have gotten inspiration from Alexander McQueen Spring 2012 RTWAdele’s accessories were definitely inspired….by McQueen 2012 Spring RTW and Louis Vuitton Spring 2012Lilith and Eden Giftset clearly took some direction from Gucci’s 2012 Spring RTWDania looks to have been inspired by Integrity’s design captain Jason Wu – Spring 2012 RTW**Photos used in the post were from www.style.com and Integrity Toys, Inc.**April 10, 2012 | Categories: Fashion Royalty | Tags: Fashion Inspiration, Fashion Royalty, Fashion Royalty Squared, Integrity Toys, Integrity Toys 2012 Product Reveal, Nu.Face | 12 CommentsIntegrity Toys 2012 Reveal…AMAZING!!!The word in the headline says it all….AMAZING!! One of the many reasons I enjoy being part of Integrity Toys WClub is the opportunity to join their webinar each year to see a presentation of what is to come for the entire year. They do not have a booth at toy fair. Instead they do a presentation for their dealers and collectors via the internet and I absolutely love that. Integrity have done this webinar for the past two years and I think it is a brilliant move. You don’t have to spend time and money to travel anywhere thus saving that money to instead buy product….smart business. You can sit in the privacy of your own home, in your PJ’s if you want, and see all the wonderful products lined up for the year and hear about the inspiration that went into them from the designers. You have to be a WClub member to attend . I know…I know…you don’t want to hear about it…you want to see it.If you want to see a jazzy version of the Fashion Royalty 2012 collection, I did a slideshow of all the photos set to music.

She was extremely severe looking and that is not the aesthetic I go for. When the designers at Integrity gave her a softer makeup palette and glorious red hair….I had to have her. She is becoming one of my favorite models. I kept thinking, wouldn’t she look fabulous in white or cream with all that red hair so, I decided to steal the Vera Wang bridal gown from one of the Barbie girls and loved the look. The dress was sewn on to its previous owner so I had to sew it on ,temporarily, to Miss Elise. I could have taken the time to put hooks and eyes on it but was impatient to photograph so that job will wait until later. The props used in these shots are simple wall shelves from Target.Click on photos for larger viewAnd here are the photos that resultedFRSquared Dark SwanElise Jolie in Vera WangVIEW SLIDE SHOW DOWNLOAD ALL–RebeccaMarch 8, 2011 | Categories: Elise Jolie, Fashion Royalty | Tags: Dark Swan Elise, Doll Photography, Fashion Royalty Squared, Inside the fashion doll studio, Rebecca Berry Photography, Vera Wang Wedding Barbie | Leave a comment"
