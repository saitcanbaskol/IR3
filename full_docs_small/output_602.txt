"In: Facts Targeting DiseaseIs cancer a genetic disease?Cancer is the most common human genetic disease. The transition from a normal cell to a malignant cancer is driven by changes to a cell’s DNA, also known as mutations.BackgroundThe cells? in the human body work together, dividing and reproducing in a strictly controlled and coordinated fashion.DNA replication? is an essential part of cell division?, whereby the cell makes an identical copy of its genome? before it divides.Mistakes or ‘Most of these mistakes are quickly repaired by the cell’s machinery, but sometimes mistakes are missed and the change in theIf these mutations occur in cancer?.Proto-oncogenes encourage the cell to multiply. If these genes become mutated they tell the cell to multiply all the time and are then called oncogenes.Tumour suppressor genes stop the cell from multiplying. If these genes are mutated and stop working, the cells may carry on multiplying.To become cancerous, a cell must acquire mutations in several growth-controlling genes.Mutations can accumulate over many years before a cell becomes cancerous. This is why most types of cancer are more common in older people.The cancer cycleUncontrolled cell growth is the hallmark of cancer.The rate and timing of cell division in the body is normally highly regulated.However, if the genes that directly regulate the cell cycle are mutated, this regulation is lost and uncontrolled cell division occurs:Numerous mutations in genes controlling the cell cycle enable cells to multiply out of control.This leads to a mass of cells that continues to grow and grow, eventually developing into a tumour.Initially the tumour is confined to the tissue in which it is located, for example, the breast tissue. However, as the tumour gets bigger it requires more nutrients, so starts to develop its own blood vessel network. This process is called angiogenesis.The cancer cells then develop the ability to migrate around the body via the bloodstream or lymphatic vessels. This process is called metastasis.Illustration showing how uncontrolled cell growth leads to cancer.

For example, exposure to carcinogens from tobacco is linked to several cancers, including lung, bladder, mouth and throat cancers.The links between environmental factors and cancer are complex and vary depending on the individual.Is this page helpful?Yes NoShare Tweet PinThis page was last updated on 2016-01-25What is a complex disease?FactsMany common diseases are influenced by a combination of multiple genes and environmental factors.
