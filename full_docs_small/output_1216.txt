Add the first question.User ReviewsSweet movie3 April 2004 | by Brigid O Sullivan (wisewebwoman) – See all my reviewsNot much to it but a validation of small town values and the embracing of a mentally challenged young man into its heart. I read some of the reviews and was surprised at some of the hostility it engendered. I felt Cuba Gooding handled the part with dignity and respect unlike Sean Penn's drooling fool portrayal in ""I am Sam."" The fact that this is based on a true story makes it all the more heartwarming. Sports are taken seriously in small town high school America (and elsewhere, I suspect) and I felt the portrayal of these competitive students opening their hearts to one less fortunate rang true, at least for me. The coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and Radio but rather came gently to the decision himself under Radio's loving and open ways. Very well done to all. 7 out of 10. Debra Winger, we need more of you in pictures!22 of 33 people found this review helpful.
