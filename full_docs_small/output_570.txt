Of course the first breed people associate with racing is the Thoroughbred. This breed has hundreds of years of selective breeding to be faster at longer distances. But he comes in second place right after the American Quarter Horse. The Quarter Horse is the fastest breed over 1/4 mile races. He is bred for sprinting and he does it well. After these would be horses that are bred to race inside of their breed. An example would be the Arabian. Within the breed, these horses are raced against other Arabs, as are American Paints and Appaloosas. The Paint and Appaloosa registries allow Thoroughbred breeding so the horses that you see on the track at Paint or Appaloosa events may have Jockey Club close up in their pedigree. So there you have it. These are the fastest breeds. Keep in mind that every once in a while a mixed breed horse will be an outstanding athlete and may outrun anything in his locality. So breeding is important but sometimes you will get a fluke. That's what make horse racing fun. The fastest horse breed is the Throughbred, and the second fastest is the American Quarter horse.4 people found this usefulWas this answer useful?YesSomewhatNoSummerMaple 31,552 ContributionsWhat is the fastest breed of horse?Over short distances (up to about a quarter mile) it is the American Quarter Horse.
