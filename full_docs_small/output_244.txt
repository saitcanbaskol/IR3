Webster's Dictionary defines fate as a power that supposedly predetermines events. Fate is synonymous to the word destiny, which suggests that events are unavoidable and unchangeable. Whatever happens in life is meant to be and cannot be changed by mankind. In Shakespeare's Macbeth, fate plays an important role in the lives of Macbeth, Lady Macbeth and Banquo. ""All hail, Macbeth Hail to thee, thane of Glamis! All hail, Macbeth Hail to thee, thane of Cawdor! All hail, Macbeth Hail to thee, thou shall be King hereafter!"" (1.3.49) The witches help fate out by giving Macbeth this information. If Macbeth had never known this, he would never have had the idea of becoming thane of Cawdor or king. This is the start to Macbeth's road to success and ultimate demise. It was predetermined by fate that Macbeth would believe the witches' words. When Macbeth does in fact become thane of Cawdor, he then believes fully in the witches and is willing to do anything it takes to become king. This willingness to do whatever is necessary to become the king of Scotland is also what causes Macbeth to commit so many murders, the first of which is Duncan. In order for Macbeth to be king, the current king must die and his successors must be unavailable for the throne. Fate plays a huge hand in the way that Duncan's murder plays out. Duncan's two sons flee so that they will not be suspected of committing a crime that they did not, the murder of their own father. Because they have fled the country, it is Macbeth that is the one who may become king. Fate also plays a role in the death of Macbeth. Because the witches were right about Macbeth's life the first time, he believed them a second time, which led to his death. They told him that he should watch out for MacDuff, that he could not be harmed by any man who was born of a woman, and that he would reign until Birnam wood came to Dunsinane hill. This gave Macbeth a false sense of security and made him think that no one could ever harm him. However, the weird sisters' twisted words gave fate the chance to cause Macbeth's ruin when an army concealed by the branches of Birnam wood came to Dunsinane hill to bring Macbeth down.Need Writing Help?Get feedback on grammar, clarity, concision and logic instantly.Check your paper »How to Cite this PageMLA Citation: ""Fate in Macbeth."" 123HelpMe.com. 11 Apr 2018 <http://www.123HelpMe.com/view.asp?id=161382>.Title Length Color RatingMacbeth - How Fate Disappointed Essay - How Fate Disappointed in Macbeth How forceful was fate in the venerable Shakespearean tragedy Macbeth.

He is the only one who could kill Macbeth because he was not born by natural birth. The witches also play a role in making Lady Macbeth convince Macbeth to commit the murders. The witches tell Macbeth that he will become thane of Cawdor as well as king of Scotland. When he tells this information to his wife, she begins to plot the murder of Duncan, something that would never have happened without the witches' words. Lady Macbeth herself also plays a role in the fate of Macbeth. She is ultimately the reason that the murder of Duncan is carried out and Macbeth is successfully not blamed for the murder. Macbeth has conflicting feelings about the murder of his friend and king, Duncan, but Lady Macbeth criticizes him, saying that he is not a man unless he goes through with murdering Duncan. Whenever Macbeth starts to show weakness, she is the fateful force that drives him to do the things that are planned out by fate. Even though Lady Macbeth is a figure of fate herself, fate turns on her, causing her to go crazy and kill herself. She begins to feel remorse for what she caused Macbeth to do. She feels that she is ultimately to blame for all of the bad events that were caused by Duncan's murder, which she drove her husband to commit. Because she was destined to do this, she had no control over what happened. However, because she is a human form of fate, she has human feelings of remorse and pity for Duncan and all of the other people whose deaths were caused by this one act of fate. These human feelings are what eventually cause her demise. Fate plays a role in the events in Banquo's life during the play. The witches also had a prophecy for Banquo in the beginning of the play. ""Though shalt get kings, though thou be none"" (1.3.67). Banquo's sons are destined to be kings, although Banquo will never be king. Later in the play Banquo is murderd by assassins hired by Macbeth. Macbeth hires these murderes because he feels threatened by Banquo and his son, Fleance. Macbeth orders the assassins to murder both of the men so that the treat to him will be gone. However, fate steps in and saves Fleance's life so that the witches' prophecies will be true. If fate had not had a role in this, either Banquo would have lived and caused Macbeth's evil plans to be uncoiled and caused his demise, or Fleance would have died like Macbeth wanted him to and the witches telling of fate would be wrong. These three characters' lives have been predetermined by fate. Everything that happened to them or didn't happen to them was a direct result of fate's plan for them. This is also true in everyday life. There is no such thing as chance and everything happens for a reason. It all comes back to fate. Nothing ever happens by coincidence and the power to chose is an illusion."
