"Staying Healthy and Avoiding COPD ExacerbationsWhat is a COPD Exacerbation?An acute exacerbation of COPD is a flare-up or episode when your breathing gets worse than usual and you become sick. It is most often linked to an infection. Exacerbations can be serious, causing you to call your health care provider, go to the emergency room, or stay overnight in the hospital. Having exacerbations often can actually cause your COPD to progress faster, so it’s important to help prevent them as much as possible.You can learn to avoid acute exacerbations by recognizing early warning signs and then taking action to stop them in their tracks! The best way to do this is to work with your health care provider on an action plan so you know what to do to treat an exacerbation before it becomes serious. Show your health care provider the following list of early warning signs and ask, “When do you want me to call you?”Early warning signs of an acute exacerbation:It is important that you call your doctor at the earliest sign of a flare-up. He/she will help you make decisions on the best course of action for you. This may include different medicines from the ones you are regularly taking.Wheezing, or more wheezing than what’s normal for youCoughing more than usualShortness of breath that is worse than usualAn increase in the amount of mucusChange in the color of your mucus to yellow, green, tan, or bloodyShallow or rapid breathing, more than what’s normal for youFeverConfusion or excessive sleepinessSwelling in your feet or anklesDuring a flare-up, your doctor may suggest that you use nebulized medicines. Many of the bronchodilators and corticosteroid medicines are prescribed for use in a nebulizer. This is a device that turns liquid medicine into vapor so you can inhale it. If your doctor prescribes these drugs, your home oxygen supplier or pharmacy should have an appropriate nebulizer for you to use. Most prescription plans cover nebulizers.Another option your doctor may suggest is using a short oral/systemic course of steroids, and/or a course of antibiotics.Tips for healthy living with COPD to help you avoid acute exacerbations:See your health care professional at your regularly scheduled appointment even if you feel fineGet your flu shot every year.
