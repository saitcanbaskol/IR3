"Techdirt – How MoviePass Makes MoneyCable's Top Lobbyist Just Can't Understand Why... >><< Corporate Sovereignty Trumps National Laws...Copyrightby Mike MasnickThu, Apr 23rd 2015 4:01amFiled Under: copyright, dmca, dmca 1201, drm, section 1201, technology protection measures, triennial reviewCompanies: gm, john deerePermalink.Short link.GM Says That While You May Own Your Car, It Owns The Software In It, Thanks To Copyrightfrom the copyright-is-broken deptLast week, we noted that Senator Ron Wyden and Rep. Jared Polis had introduced an important bill to fix a part of the DMCA's broken anti-circumvention laws found in Section 1201 of the DMCA. For whatever reason, some people still have trouble understanding why the law is so broken. So here's a story that hopefully makes the point clearly. Thanks to DMCA 1201, John Deere claims it still owns the tractor you thought you bought from it. Instead, John Deere claims you're really just licensing that tractor: In the absence of an express written license in conjunction with the purchase of the vehicle, the vehicle owner receives an implied license for the life of the vehicle to operate the vehicle, subject to any warranty limitations, disclaimers or other contractual limitation in the sales contract or documentation. How nice of John Deere to say that your ability to operate the vehicle is really subject to the ""implied license"" it granted you. These comments (and many others) come in response to the ridiculous triennial review process in which the Librarian of Congress reviews requests to ""exempt"" certain cases from Section 1201's rules against circumvention. We discussed the ridiculous responses from some concerning video game archiving last week, and the John Deere statement is in response to requests to diagnose, repair or modify vehicle software. And, of course, lots of car companies are against this, including GM, which argues that all hell will break loose if people can diagnose problems in their own cars' computers. It, too, thinks that you don't really own your car and worries that people are mixed up in thinking they own the software that makes the car they bought run: Proponents incorrectly conflate ownership of a vehicle with ownership of the underlying computer software in a vehicle.... Although we currently consider ownership of vehicle software instead of wireless handset software, the law’s ambiguity similarly renders it impossible for Proponents to establish that vehicle owners own the software in their vehicles (or even own a copy of the software rather than have a license), particularly where the law has not changed. But the real conflation here is by GM, John Deere, and others, in thinking that because they hold a copyright to some software, that somehow gives them ownership over what you do with the copy you legally purchased with the car itself. Once that purchase is concluded, the vehicle owners should be seen to have given up any proprietary interest in the single vehicle you bought. But thanks to copyright and Section 1201, that's an issue that faces ""uncertainty."" And that's a problem. The companies lay out a parade of horribles that will happen if people can circumvent the DRM they put in their vehicles, mostly focused on the idea that people might soup up their car, making it dangerous. But that's not a copyright issue. People have always souped up cars, and before there was software in cars, no one argued that Ford could prevent you from turning your Mustang into a drag racer. It's only copyright that has rewritten the very concept of ownership in a dangerous way. As Kyle Wiens notes in his article at Wired in response to the ""but, but, car modders!"" argument: They’re right. That could happen. But those activities are (1) already illegal, and (2) have nothing to do with copyright. If you’re going too fast, a cop should stop you—copyright law shouldn’t. If you’re dodging emissions regulations, you should pay EPA fines—not DMCA fines. And the specter of someone doing something illegal shouldn’t justify shutting down all the reasonable and legal modifications people can make to the things they paid for. But, by far, the most ridiculous in the ""parade of horribles"" comes from John Deere who was really, really, really, really stretching to try to come up with some way to pretend this is really about copyright issues. It argues that allowing farmers to modify the software in their tractors might lead those farmers to (and I am not making this up), listen to infringing music while they farm. Moreover, TPMs for vehicle software for entertainment systems protects copyright owners of copyrighted content against the unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copyrighted works. For example, vehicle software for entertainment systems supports the playing of copyrighted music files and copyrighted audio books, among other expressive works. A vehicle driver may listen to sound recordings, while passengers may watch or view television and movie content. TPMs for in-vehicle entertainment systems encourage content providers to create and distribute highly-expressive copyrighted works that might otherwise be easily copied or pirated if the TPMs were circumvented. Consequently, circumvention of the above TPMs for purposes of “personalization, modification, or other improvement” is likely to encourage the unauthorized reproduction, distribution, and use of copyrighted software and content. I really feel sorry for whatever recent law school grad had this issue dumped on their desk and was told, ""make this about copyright... some way... any way."" But all it really does is highlight the sheer ridiculousness of Section 1201 and how it's destroying property rights.

No one buys a vehicle and believes that they are making two purchases (or a purchase and a license in this case), one for the car, and one for the software required for it to run. That would be like buying the car, but licensing the wheels. One does nothing without the other, so the idea that they should be treated as separate items is absurd.

Nobody involved in that wants the data flow interrupted, so using DRM anti-circumvention to prevent owners from taking control of their own vehicles and thus their privacy is a useful strategy. Of course adding some FUD and a bogus safety argument helps, too. It is of course perfectly possible to build a car that doesn't spy on its owners -- but that's not what's happening.

Here is your example: Say a company purchases a volume license agreement, but fails to protect it and it get out on a hackers site. Sorry about your luck, your purchase is now null and void and anyone who tries to use that key finds out that it has been revoked. Say said company goes back to Microsoft to get another volume license. They could be denied due to their lack of adherence to following previous agreement.

I see a couple of problems with this. 1) If the manufacturers claim copyright, then the licensee (that's you) is unable to sell on the car, since that would be distribution of their copyrighted work (i.e. the in-vehicle software). 2) Do you, upon buying the car, sign a licensing agreement with the manufacturer to the effect that you agree to having purchased a license, not the software? A license can not be implied just because on party wishes it so. And what if you don't agree to their terms? Can they remove 'their' software and leave you with the car you bought? If not, the licensing terms could be deemed unconscionable and therefore invalid. 3) If memory serves (so I could be wrong), the majority of in-car software is built on top of open source software and, if so, the manufacturers have to abide by the terms of the that license, which, as likely as not, prohibits their claiming ownership of anything other than the bits they added on top. Anything else invalidates the license. This brazen (and unilateral) attempt by car manufacturers to turn the concept of ownership on its head is a sure sign the system is broken and needs fixing.

I own and use a car that's over 16 years old. Depsite that the car the car still runs more than satisfactorily. Plus I can still easily get parts for it. In contrast, the average lifespan for the operating system of a computer is around five years. Microsoft Windows 2000, for example, which is nearly as old as my car, is no longer being supported by Microsoft. Neither is Windows XP. That means that while you can still use those systsmes if you truly want to Microsoft is no longer providing updates to fix problems with them. That includes fix for security problems, system crashes, etc. That raises the question of how long car software makers like John Deere are going to support the software they produce for cars. Will the day come when they too will say: sorry, we aren't producing any more software updates for your make and model of automobile. What then? Consider the current problem with one particular model of Takata airbags which the press have been reporting on. That model is used in many car models. It can also, potentially, kill the occupants in certain situations. Imagine if Takata could say: ""We don't support that model any more. Have a nice day."" At least with airbags you could (maybe) find a different airbag manufacturer. Or at least disable the airbag system in your car. Neither of those is really an option for the software in modern cars. So what happens if car software is still being used beyond the period the software maker will be providing updates for? What happens if one day a fatal (so-to-speak) bug is discovered in that software. Will their response be: ""Sorry, we no longer support that version of our software. Try our latest version.

GM recently earned a lifetime boycott from me, when I discovered I couldn't even get the car I wanted to buy, without on-star. As #7 mentioned- GM is moving to include on-star in all their vehicles... on-star logs everything and sends it to GM, who openly admit to selling the data to third parties, and allowing it's use for anything. You can still unplug the box- but then you don't get navigation or sat radio.

[ reply to this | link to this | view in chronology ]Rich Kulawiec, 23 Apr 2015 @ 8:03amRe:I predict within the decade people will literally be killed by hackers due to the negligent design of these systems [...] First, I doubt it will take that long. Second, I doubt that it'll require hacking skills. The enormous databases being built by operations like OnStar are are a motherlode for pedophiles, stalkers, rapists, serial killers, and other fine upstanding citizens. They will be hacked -- not necessarily by those people -- and they will be sold on the open market and they will be used to target individuals. Of course, this may have already happened. Third, direct attacks against vehicles are of course laughably simple, but makers are taking the same approach as voting machine vendors: (1) deny (2) lie (3) obfuscate (4) attack researchers (5) censor research (6) block research using DRM/copyright/etc. It'll probably take a number of high-profile deaths before regulatory agencies step in and force makers to actually address these problems. However, absent a complete re-engineering of the systems, that won't be effective: security never works as add-on, it has to be baked in.

I mean, c'mon world, we did this for wireless telephones and garage-door openers thanks to illicit listeners and burglaries. I'm pretty sure that a mayor didn't have to get his house invaded for those technologies to be developed.

And in most cases this software has already been hacked or modded by someone and the code is out there. Can't claim anything on the car if it's all old school physical parts. Also the argument could be made (although I don't know how true it would be) that it's more environmentally conscious to continue using an old car as resources aren't continually being used to keep building new ones.

Yes, I wonder about this as well. Older cars are much, much worse on the environment than newer ones in operation, but when taking into account manufacturing impact, which way does the balance tip? It was the Prius that got me thinking about that years ago, because batteries and chips are both very bad for the environment to manufacture (and dispose of), and I wondered if the overall environmental harm is actually lower with the Prius vs traditional cars. Studies since have shown that generally speaking, no, it's not lower. It just changes the type and location of the environmental impact.

Thus the licence typically allowed you to make the ephemeral copies necessary to run the program, to install it onto your hard drive and to make a backup. All of this would have been technically illegal under copyright law as understood in the 50s and 60s. Thus the licence was always IN ADDITION to the rights that you automatically acquired on purchase. Now however they seem to want to make the licence into something that takes away rights that you had. This may not be legally sound - but since when has that stopped them?

[ reply to this | link to this | view in chronology ]Uriel-238  ( profile ), 23 Apr 2015 @ 12:41pmThis may present a case for a class-action suit.I remember when Microsoft had to re-device Windows 95 because Internet Explorer was overly integrated (as part of Windows Explorer ). At the time Netscape was the primary competing product, and there was concern about how given hardware was only accessible through specific software, when the company developing the software had an investment in limiting how the software was used. As was noted by the folks of Digital Research, people who make hardware shouldn't make software, and people who make operating systems shouldn't make applications, in both cases due to the moral hazard that arrises. Sure enough Microsoft Windows is full of hidden features that are intentionally included yet concealed to give licensed developers an edge over those coding on their own. And some are reserved for the in-house developers such as those who make the Office suite. If there's a separate license for vehicle software vs. vehicle hardware, then it should be possible to run the hardware with third-party software. That, or the software should be required to be open-source and licensed for life. To do any less creates a moral hazard in which the company creating the software will be tempted to optimize the software as best suits the company and not the end user, lest it run the engine to wear out faster, or just stop running at all after the one-hundred-thousanth mile. Of course, the courts may be so deep in the pockets of the manufacturers that this is moot. So these are thoughts for the next iteration of civilization, once we re-invent the motor vehicle.
