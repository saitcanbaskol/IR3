Many breeds develop skin disorders from the interaction between genetics and the dog's environment. (see table for dog breeds and related skin disease)Genetics plays an important role in determining the cause of skin disease. Many genetic diseases are well defined in terms of clinical signs and can provide important diagnostic clues. Recent advances in mapping the canine genome are increasing the numbr of diseases that can be traced back to a genetic defect. Some of these can be confirmed with genetic testing. Others such as dog hair loss at birth or at age 2 to 4 weeks are clear indications of a genetic disorder.Doberman With Multiple Skin ProblemsDoberman with multiple dog skin problems such as yeast Malassezia dermatitis, bacterial skin infection and demodex (mange).
