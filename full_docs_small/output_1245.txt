"Home > What to do in Northumberland > Hadrian's WallHadrian's WallJoining the Great Barrier Reef and Yellowstone National Park as a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site, Hadrian’s Wall is one of England’s greatest landmarks. Hadrian's Wall leaves a lasting impression on any who visit, including writer George RR Martin who used it as inspiration for his own Wall in the bestselling books and hit TV series, Game of Thrones. The best-preserved frontier of the Roman Empire and the nation’s finest Roman monument, great stretches of the Wall remain intact in Northumberland. But this Roman megastructure is not just an isolated ruin. The Wall and surrounding countryside here is scattered with milecastles, temples and Roman forts such as Housesteads, Vindolanda and Epiacum, which can be seen on Robson Greens Further Tales from Northumberland. There are archaeological sites and museums along the Wall telling the epic story of Rome’s rise and fall. Take to the stunning landscape of Hadrian’s Wall Country by foot or bike and enjoy dramatic views unchanged since Roman times. As well as its Roman treasures, Hadrian’s Wall Country has a wealth of non-Roman finds to explore too. Take a walk west from Housesteads Crag to Sycamore Gap to see both the highest remains of the Wall and the solitary tree immortalised in the film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. The pretty village of Wylam is the birthplace of George Stephenson, pioneering railway engineer and inventor of the ‘Rocket’, the famous railway locomotive. Carry on the railway theme and board a train on the Hadrian’s Wall Country Line. Hop on and off to explore towns and villages with a character all of their own, like Haltwhistle, Bardon Mill and Hexham.Also of interestCycle routesFilm & TV Locations Getting around Hadrian's WallRoman fortsRoman MuseumsRoman WallScenic sectionsWalks - Hadrian's WallWhat to do What's on Where to staySearch for things to doAreaOr draw your own areaTownwithinTypeAdditional optionsSearchPhoto GallerySign up for our newsletterEmailSign me upUseful linksAD122 Hadrian's Wall Country BusEnglish Heritage sites along Hadrian's WallHexham Tourist Information CentreHistory and HeritageStar Gazing in NorthumberlandView our brochure online"
