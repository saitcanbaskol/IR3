"‘Will I Be Able to Get a Job After College?’Gaye Tuchman is a professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut and author of ""Wannabe U: Inside the Corporate University."" She taught at Queens College and the C.U.N.Y. Graduate Center for nearly 20 years.Updated January 25, 2011, 5:24 PMI once thought my task was to increase the critical ability and intellectual imagination of my undergraduates. I piled on books and papers in small classes; my students handed in their work; I graded it.Colleges have become economic engines where students, burdened by debt, just want to make money.Two decades ago, I discovered that I had erred: My job is to stoke the coal that propels my state’s train. Echoing his predecessors and politicians around the country, last month Governor-elect Daniel Malloy told a crowd that this ""University is a critical engine for the state’s economy and our workforce. An invigorated UConn goes a long way to creating a more economically healthy Connecticut.”The 325 students who now populate my classroom have told me essentially the same thing. “Why are you here?” I ask them. “To get a better job,” they tell me. It’s a reasonable answer from in-state undergraduates paying as much as $25,000. (The out-of-state cost is almost $42,000, a “best value” according to Kiplinger’s.)I treat this large class differently. I assign a textbook, keep written assignments to a minimum, and hope my teaching assistants mark the papers quickly. The conditions of my work have changed. Once the most respected professors on campus were the best teachers; now they are the most productive researchers and high-flying grant-getters. Some colleges use teaching as punishment and assign extra courses to faculty who don’t publish enough.The students have changed, too. National statistics announce that they are from less wealthy backgrounds and borrow to pay tuition that (at public colleges) was once free; more of them graduate with a larger debt than the undergraduates of previous years. First-generation college students have long had a vocational orientation; but facing an uncertain economic future, today’s students are more likely to ask, “What do I need to study for the exam?” What they really want to know is, “What do intellectual matters have to do with my life? Will I be able to get a job?”Topics: Education, colleges, studentsPreviousA Different Type of StudentC. Kent McGuireNextProducts of Rote LearningLeon Botstein"
