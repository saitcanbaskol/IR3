"Question by mlahlou324 (29)Should I be concerned that my tattoo is starting to raise?Does this mean something is wrong with my tattoo?+ 12vote upAnswer by jh (138)If you have recently gotten your tattoo, you should not be concerned. As your skin starts to heal, scar tissue is formed, which can cause it to raise temporarily.add a comment+ 7vote upAnswer by sugarbooger (21)Tattoos often raise if the artist used too much pressure, resulting in excessive scar tissue. You could be having a reaction to the particular ink used. Many people are sensitive to red ink. Some tattoos even raise in response to the weather - heat and humidity generally exacerbate matters. If it's a new tattoo, it could calm down with time.add a comment+ 6vote upAnswer by AnonymousActually, a few people have this backwards. Raising in the tattoo is a good thing, it means the depth of the needle was correct. if it sinks it means he went to deep. your tattoo will always raise. If its continuously rasing and not going down I would get itcheckedoutadd a comment+ 5vote upAnswer by AnonymousThat is happening to my newest tat. Its normal. just don't mess/pick@ the scab let it just fall off! Made that mistake before and had to have it completely redone. And it still doesn't look right. Leave it be and it will turn out fine!add a comment+ 5vote upAnswer by cattybratty (181)A tattoo that ""raises"" is pretty normal. Ink has been deposited beneath your skin and it takes some time for your body to get used to it.add a comment+ 5vote upAnswer by MM (26)If your tattoo is new, it is normal for it to raise up. Let the scab fall off on its own, and your tattoo will be flat again!add a comment+ 4vote upAnswer by pakuakid (72)If your tattoo is new (under a month) then swelling is not uncommon. If it is older than a month it is scar tissue. Neither are a serious problem.add a comment+ 2vote upAnswer by mandmforever (91)Ewwwwwww!!! That's werid!! I guess it could be normal though.
