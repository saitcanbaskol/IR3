It is concerned with allphases of control of communicable, vector-borne, and occupational diseases and with theprevention of disease, injury, and disability. Its responsibilities include epidemiology,surveillance, detection, laboratory science, ecological investigations, training, disease controlmethods, chronic disease prevention, health promotion, and injury prevention and control. Itsmajor tasks include the licensing of qualified clinical laboratories for interstate commerce,maintenance of laboratories as reference centers for microorganisms and infectious diseases,and operation of extensive research programs in the prevention, detection and control of disease.The CDC's name has changed several times to reflect its expanding role; it has been called theCommunicable Disease Center  (1946), the Center for Disease Control  (1970), and the Centers forDisease Control  (1980). The latest name change, enacted by Congress in 1992, reflects theexpansion of the scope of the CDC's mission to include health promotion and education.Because of the widespread recognition of the acronym CDC, that acronym continues to be used by the agency. The mailing address of the CDC is Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,1600 Clifton Rd.
