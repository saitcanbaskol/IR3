I tend to use my devices without any case, and will likely continue to do so, but there is something about that flip case I like. It has a style and professional look that keeps me checking it out. I haven't purchased it yet, but I was curiuos to know how you like it thus far?

It does ad a level of professionalism to the look of the phone. I also have the Gear S so that enables me to not have to open my flip cover even time I need to respond to a notification. I would just really love to have the option of the s view cover. ✒✒ Sent from my fantastic and feature rich ( And i'd like to point out anything but a gimmic) Samsung Galaxy Note Edge. 12-18-2014 08:56 AM Like 065https://forums.androidcentral.com/showthread.php?t=473134&p=4133447&viewfull=1#post4133447joganjaniI love flip wallet too but I cannot find it anywhere in AT&T shops.

I don't think they will be making one with s view though. The question is why? You still need to open the flip case on the edge now to take a pic, write a memo, dial a contact, anything. At least with the s view case you can call, take notes, use camera etc. The edge panel is not so functional that I can operate my phone with the flip closed. I mean they should have at least has a quick dial panel so you could put say 10 contacts on it, then tap one and it dials with the cover closed. Just anything to make the edge panel even more functional while the cover is closed. It is kind of frustrating to be honest, that we have thw most expensive phone in samsungs lineup and the edge panel is only useful as a night clock and notification system while the flip cover is closed. I mean the s view cover on the note 4 provides a ton of functionality to its users. And in reality the s view cover is just a flip case with a cut out, and a simple software update would install the needed code for us edge users to use it. This, of course is my humble opinion.

In some instances, I cannot see the need of the screen protector if you have a flip case. Especially, since I have the Gear S. Also the screen protectors that are out now have a ridge on the edge so, I am not sure I would like that.

I have no protection on mine other that the flip case. I also have the Gear S and Gear circle. Also there will be a tempered glass screen protector released by the end of the month (so I have read).

I mentioned before that I don't think normally like to use a case on my phones but from what I saw there was a sleek professionalism about the flip case I liked. I just picked one up at Best Buy and have been using it the last few days. It's taking me a little bit to get used to but I think I'll keep it. As you mentioned earlier, I do wish the panel was functional with the cover closed because it seems odd to have to open the cover for what seems like simple task that could be performed with the panel? It's all new though, and I'm sure someone at Samsung has noticed this oversight by now. Hopefully they will add the functionality to this phone, or it will surely be available on the E2 (Edge 2).

Das and Chris, how do you like your circles? I read and saw many reviews where people complain that they fall off of your ear. Have you guys notice same problem? Also, do you have to use that neck choker thingy to carry the weight of the back piece? Please share your experience. I have owned the Circle for two weeks now and it works really well. The ear buds falling out has not been my experience. They stay in pretty good, but you do have to ensure you select the correct size for your ears. One other thing I noticed after two days of use is that I had the gels in wrong so it's important to make sure the gels are installed properly. The neck guards are actually quite comfortable to me. I forget I have them on, and I wear my Circle everyday, all day. The only negative, and it's a fairly small one, is that the headphones have no way of laying flat around my neck. The earbuds stick out when resting. It's not that big of a deal, and from a design standpoint I can't think of anyway to remedy it, but that would be the only negative. They have really made my life easier.
