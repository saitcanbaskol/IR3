"Movement disordersFollow City-Data.com founder on our Forum or @LechMazurPhoto by: Natalia PavlovaDefinitionMovement disorders are a group of diseases and syndromes affecting the  ability to produce and control bodily movements.DescriptionIt seems simple and effortless, but normal movement requires an  astonishingly complex system of control. Disruption of any portion of this  system can cause a person to produce movements that are too weak, too  forceful, too uncoordinated, or too poorly controlled for the task at  hand. Unwanted movements may occur at rest. Intentional movement may  become impossible. Such conditions are called movement disorders.Abnormal movements are symptoms of underlying disorders. In some cases,  the abnormal movements are the only symptoms. Childhood disorders or  conditions that may cause abnormal movements include:cerebral palsychoreoasthetosisencephalopathiesessential tremorinherited ataxias ( Friedreich's ataxia , Machado-Joseph disease, and spinocerebellar ataxias)multiple sclerosisparkinsonism and juvenile Parkinson's diseasepoisoning by carbon monoxide, cyanide, methanol, or manganesepsychogenic disordersrestless legs syndromespasticitystrokeTourette syndrome and other tic disordersWilson diseaseDemographicsThe incidence rates and demographics vary for different types of movement  disorders. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) affects approximately 12 million  people in the United States. The disorder can affect males and females and  can begin at any age, although it may become worse as a person gets older.  The most common ataxia is Friedreich's ataxia; in the United  States, it affects one in 50,000 people, both male and female.Causes and symptomsCausesMovement is produced and coordinated by several interacting brain centers,  including the motor cortex, the cerebellum, and a group of structures in  the inner portions of the brain called the basal ganglia. Sensory  information provides critical input on the current position and velocity  of body parts, and spinal nerve cells (neurons) help prevent opposing  muscle groups from contracting at the same time.To understand how movement disorders occur, it is helpful to consider a  normal voluntary movement, such as reaching to touch a nearby object with  the right index finger. To accomplish the desired movement, the arm must  be lifted and extended. The hand must be held out to align with the  forearm, and the forefinger must be extended while the other fingers  remain flexed.THE MOTOR CORTEX Voluntary motor commands begin in the motor cortex, located on the outer  wrinkled surface of the brain. Movement of the right arm is begun by the  left motor cortex, which generates a large volley of signals to the  involved muscles. These electrical signals pass along upper motor neurons  through the midbrain to the spinal cord. Within the spinal cord, they connect to lower motor neurons, which convey the signals out of the  spinal cord to the surface of the muscles involved. Electrical stimulation  of the muscles causes contraction, and the force of contraction pulling on  the skeleton causes movement of the arm, hand, and fingers.Damage to or death of any of the neurons along this path causes weakness  or paralysis of the affected muscles.ANTAGONISTIC MUSCLE PAIRS The previous description of movement is too simple, however. One  important refinement to it comes from considering the role of opposing, or  antagonistic, muscle pairs. Contraction of the biceps muscle, located on  the top of the upper arm, pulls on the forearm to flex the elbow and bend  the arm. Contraction of the triceps, located on the opposite side, extends  the elbow and straightens the arm. Within the spine, these muscles are  normally wired so that willed (voluntary) contraction of one is  automatically accompanied by blocking of the other. In other words, the  command to contract the biceps provokes another command within the spine  to prevent contraction of the triceps. In this way, these antagonist  muscles are kept from resisting one another. Spinal cord or brain injury  can damage this control system and cause involuntary simultaneous  contraction and spasticity, an increase in resistance to movement during  motion.THE CEREBELLUM Once the movement of the arm is initiated, sensory information is needed  to guide the finger to its precise destination. In addition to sight, the  most important source of information comes from the ""position  sense"" provided by the many sensory neurons located within the  limbs (proprioception). Proprioception is what allows a person to touch a  finger to his or her nose, even with eyes closed. The balance organs in  the ears provide important information about posture. Both postural and  proprioceptive information are processed by a structure at the rear of the  brain called the cerebellum. The cerebellum sends out electrical signals  to modify movements as they progress, ""sculpting"" the  barrage of voluntary commands into a tightly controlled, constantly  evolving pattern. Cerebellar disorders cause inability to control the  force, fine positioning, and speed of movements (ataxia). Disorders of the  cerebellum may also impair the ability to judge distance so that a person  under- or over-reaches the target (dysmetria). Tremor during voluntary  movements can also result from cerebellar damage.THE BASAL GANGLIA Both the cerebellum and the motor cortex send information to a set of  structures deep within the brain that help control involuntary components  of movement (basal ganglia). The basal ganglia send output messages to the  motor cortex, helping to initiate movements, regulate repetitive or  patterned movements, and control muscle tone.Circuits within the basal ganglia are complex. Within this structure, some  groups of cells begin the action of other basal ganglia components and  some groups of cells block the action. These complicated feedback circuits  are not entirely understood. Disruptions of these circuits are known to  cause several distinct movement disorders. A portion of the basal ganglia  called the substantia nigra sends electrical signals that block output  from another structure called the subthalamic nucleus. The subthalamic  nucleus sends signals to the globus pallidus, which in turn blocks the  thalamic nuclei. Finally, the thalamic nuclei send signals to the motor  cortex. The substantia nigra, then, begins movement and the globus  pallidus blocks it. This complicated circuit can be disrupted at several  points.Disruptions in other portions of the basal ganglia are thought to cause tics , tremors, dystonia, and a variety of other movement disorders, although  the exact mechanisms are not well understood.Some movement disorders, including Huntington's disease and  inherited ataxias, are caused by inherited genetic defects. Some diseases  that cause sustained muscle contraction limited to a particular muscle  group (focal dystonia) are inherited, but others are caused by trauma. The  cause of most cases of Parkinson's disease is unknown, although  genes have been found for some familial forms.SymptomsAbnormal movements are broadly classified as either hyperkinetic (too much  movement) and hypokinetic (too little movement). Hyperkinetic movements  include:Dystonia—sustained muscle contractions, often causing twisting or  repetitive movements and abnormal postures. Dystonia may be limited to  one area (focal) or may affect the whole body (general). Focal dystonias  may affect the neck ( cervical dystonia or torticollis); the face  (one-sided or hemifacial spasm, contraction of the eyelid or  blepharospasm, contraction of the mouth and jaw or oromandibular  dystonia, simultaneous spasm of the chin and eyelid or Meige syndrome);  the vocal cords ( laryngeal dystonia ); or the arms and legs  (writer's cramp or occupational cramps). Dystonia may be painful  as well as incapacitating.Tremor—uncontrollable (involuntary) shaking of a body part.  Tremor may occur only when muscles are relaxed or only during an action  or while holding an active posture.Tics—involuntary, rapid, non-rhythmic movement or sound. Tics can  be controlled briefly.Myoclonus—a sudden, brief, jerky, shock-like involuntary muscle  contraction. Myoclonic jerks may occur singly or repetitively. Unlike  tics, myoclonus cannot be controlled even briefly.Spasticity—an abnormal increase in muscle tone. It may be  associated with involuntary muscle spasms , sustained muscle contractions, and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes  that make movement difficult or uncontrollable.Chorea—rapid, non-rhythmic, uncontrolled jerky movements, most  often in the arms and legs. Chorea also may affect the hands, feet,  trunk, neck, and face. Choreoathetosis is a syndrome of continuous  random movements that usually occur at rest and may appear to be  fidgety, dancing, or writhing.Ballism—like chorea, but the movements are much larger, more  explosive and involve more of the arm or leg. This condition, also  called ballismus, can occur on both sides of the body or on one side  only (hemiballismus).Akathisia—restlessness and a desire to move to relieve  uncomfortable sensations. Sensations may include a feeling of crawling, itching , stretching, or creeping, usually in the legs.Athetosis—slow, writhing, continuous, uncontrollable movement of  the arms and legs.Hypokinetic movements include:Bradykinesia—extreme slowness and stiffness of movement.Freezing—inability to begin a movement or involuntary stopping of  a movement before it is completed.Rigidity—an increase in muscle tension when an arm or leg is  moved by an outside force.Postural instability—loss of the ability to maintain upright  posture caused by slow or absent righting reflexes.DiagnosisDiagnosis of movement disorders requires a careful medical history and a  thorough physical and neurological examination.The medical history helps the physician evaluate the presence of other  conditions or disorders that might contribute to or cause the disorder.  Records of previous diagnoses, surgeries, and treatments are reviewed. The  child's family medical history is evaluated to determine if there is a history of  muscular or neurological disorders. Genetic testing is available for some  forms of movement disorders.The physical and neurological exams may include an evaluation of the  child's motor reflexes, including muscle tone, mobility, strength,  balance, and endurance; heart and lung function; cranial nerve function;  and an examination of the child's abdomen, spine, throat, and ears.  The child's height, weight, and blood pressure also are checked and  recorded. Routine blood and urine analyses are performed.Brain imaging studies are usually performed. Imaging techniques include computed tomography scan (CT scan), positron emission tomography  (PET), or magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) scans. A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) may be necessary. Video  recording of the abnormal movement is often used to analyze movement  patterns and track progress of the disorder and its treatment.Other tests may include x rays of the spine and hips or diagnostic blocks with local anesthetics to  provide information on the effectiveness of potential treatments.To aid diagnosis, a multi-disciplinary team may be consulted so the proper  treatment can be planned. Occupational and physical therapy evaluations  may be helpful to determine upper and lower extremity movement patterns  and passive range of motion.In some cases, nerve conduction studies with electromyography of the  affected muscles may be performed to evaluate the child's muscular  activity and provide a comprehensive assessment of nerve and muscle function.In both tests, the examiner uses a computer, monitor, amplifier,  loudspeaker, stimulator, and high-tech filters to see and hear how the  muscles and nerves are responding during the test. In the nerve conduction  study, small electrodes are placed on the skin over the muscles to be  examined. A stimulator delivers a very small electrical current (that does  not cause damage to the body) through the electrodes, causing the nerves  to fire. In the electromyogram, a very thin, sterilized needle is inserted  into various muscles. The needle is attached by wires to a recording  machine. The patient is asked to relax and contract the muscles being  examined. The electrical signals produced by the nerves and muscles during  these tests are measured and recorded by a computer and displayed as  electrical waves on the monitor. The test results are interpreted by a  specially trained physician.An EEG ( electroencephalogram ) may be performed to detect seizures, analyze general brain functioning, and measure brain activity associated with movement or  sensation. This test measures the electrical signals from the brain.  Surface electrodes attached to the scalp measure voltages in the brain.  The electrical activity can be measured while the child is resting or, in  some cases, when the child is moving. An evoked potentials study may be  part of the EEG test. Evoked potentials record the response of the brain  to a sensory, visual, or auditory stimulus.TreatmentTreatment of a movement disorder begins with a proper diagnostic  evaluation. Treatment options include physical and occupational therapies,  medications, surgery, or a combination of these treatments.The goals of treatment are to increase the child's comfort,  decrease pain , ease mobility, help with activities of daily living such as hygiene,  ease rehabilitation procedures, and prevent or decrease the risk of  developing a joint contracture. The type of treatment recommended will  depend upon the severity of the disorder; the child's overall  health; the potential benefits, limitations, and side effects of the  treatment; and the impact of the treatment on the child's quality  of life.Clinicians should work with the child and parents or caregivers to develop  an individual treatment plan. Specific treatment goals will vary from one  person to the next. Treatment should be provided by a movement disorders  specialist or specially trained pediatric neurologist and a  multi-disciplinary team of specialists that may include a physiatrist,  physical therapist, occupational therapist, gait and movement specialists,  social worker, and surgical specialists as applicable, such as a pediatric  orthopedic surgeon or pediatric neurosurgeon.In some cases, treatment is not recommended or desired, because it would  actually interfere with the patient's current mobility and it would  not improve function. For example, some people with multiple sclerosis who  experience significant leg weakness find that spasticity makes their legs  more rigid, helping them to stand, transfer to a chair or bed, or walk.Physical and occupational therapiesPhysical therapy includes stretching exercises, muscle group strengthening  exercises, and range of motion exercises to prevent muscles from  shortening (contracture), preserve flexibility and range of motion, and  reduce the severity of symptoms. Exercises should be practiced daily, as  recommended by the physical therapist. Prolonged stretching can lengthen  muscles, and strengthening exercises can restore the proper strength to  affected muscles. Aquatic therapy also may be recommended, since there is  less stress on the body when in the water.A physical therapist can instruct the patient on proper posture  guidelines. Proper posture is critical, especially while sitting and  sleeping, to maintain proper alignment of the hips and back. Balancing  rest and exercise is also important.Occupational therapy may include splints, casts, or braces on the affected  arm or leg to enable proper limb positioning, and maintain flexibility and  range of motion. The therapy may include training for proper limb  positioning while seated in a wheelchair or lying in bed.Physical and occupational therapists can provide guidelines on how to  adapt the child's environment to ensure safety and comfort.MedicationsMedications can help compensate for some imbalances of the basal  ganglionic circuit. Drugs to treat movement disorders include oral  medications, injected medications, and continuous delivery medications.  These medications work by preventing nerves from signaling the muscles to  contract, thereby preventing muscle contractions.If treatment with a single medicine fails to effectively treat the  disorder, a different medicine may be tried or an additional medicine may  be prescribed. The most important medication guidelines are to ensure that  the child takes the medication exactly as prescribed, and to never  discontinue any medication without first talking to the child's  doctor, even if the medication does not seem to be working or is causing  unwanted side effects.ORAL MEDICATIONS Baclofen (Lioresal) is a muscle relaxant that works on nerves in the  spinal cord to reduce spasticity. The benefits of baclofen include  decreased stretch reflexes, improved passive range of motion, and reduced  muscle spasms, pain, and tightness. Side effects include drowsiness and  sedation, as well as weakness, decreased muscle tone, confusion, fatigue, nausea , and dizziness . Baclofen should not be taken with central nervous system depressants or  alcohol.Levodopa (L-dopa) is a medication that is converted to dopamine in the  brain. Dopamine is a chemical that aids in the transmission of nerve  signals. Sinemet is a combination medication containing levodopa and  carbidopa. Carbidopa enables L-dopa to be converted to dopamine after the  L-dopa enters the brain, thereby lowering the oral dose and decreasing side effects. Side effects include nausea, diarrhea , and low blood pressure.Anticholinergics, including trihexyphenidyl (Artane) and benztropine  (Benztrop MES, Cogentin ), block acetylcholine receptors in the brain.  Acetylcholine receptors are integral proteins that respond to the  neurotransmitter acetylcholine by opening a pathway in the membrane for  ion diffusion across the cell membrane. Side effects include dry mouth,  blurred vision, constipation , urinary retention, and rapid heart rate. These side effects are usually  much less frequent in children than adults; therefore, much higher doses  are usually prescribed in children.Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (Valium), clonazepam (Klonopin,  Rivotril), and lorazepam (Ativan) act on the central nervous system to  improve passive range of motion, reduce muscle overactivity and painful  spasms, and provide overall relaxation. These medications are often taken  at night because they cause drowsiness, but they also can relieve muscle  spasms that interrupt sleep . Side effects include unsteadiness, loss of strength, low blood pressure,  gastrointestinal symptoms, memory problems, confusion, and behavioral  problems.Dantrolene sodium (Dantrium) acts on the muscles to directly interfere  with the chemistry of the muscle contraction. It is generally used when  other medications are not effective. Benefits may include improved passive  movement, decreased muscle tone, and reduced muscle spasms, tightness, and  pain. Side effects include generalized weakness—including weakness  of the respiratory muscles—as well as drowsiness, fatigue,  diarrhea, and sensitivity to the sun. Liver problems may occur with this  medication, and frequent lab tests are performed to evaluate liver  function.Tizanidine (Zanaflex) acts on the central nervous system. It does not  usually cause reduced muscle strength. The most common side effect is  sedation, and other side effects include low blood pressure, dry mouth,  dizziness, and hallucinations. Liver problems may occur with this  medication, and frequent lab tests are performed to evaluate liver  function.A variety of other medications may be used to treat movement disorders,  including antiepileptic drugs that stimulate GABA receptors in the  brain's basal ganglia; neuroleptics that block dopamine D2-like  receptors; Clonidine (Catapres) and selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors (SSRIs, such as fluoxetine, commonly known as Prozac) for the  treatment of tics; and channel modulators that affect the behavior of  channels that transport small molecules such as potassium, sodium, or  calcium across cell membranes.INJECTED MEDICATIONS Botulinum-toxin type A (Botox, Dysport) or type B (Myobloc) is injected  locally into the affected muscle group to relax the muscles in dystonia or  spasticity. It works by preventing nerves from sending signals to the  muscles that cause them to contract. Although the treatment takes one to  two weeks to reach its full effectiveness, the beneficial effects last  three to four months. Botulinum-toxin allows more normal limb positioning  and improved mobility. In some patients, the injections also decrease  pain. Injections may be used to make casting easier, ease the adjustment  of a new brace, or delay surgery.Botulinum-toxin is made by the bacteria that cause botulism . However, the amount of botulinum-toxin injected to treat spasticity is  such a small amount that it would not cause botulism poisoning. This  treatment is very safe, and the injections can be given in a  doctor's office without the use of sedation or anesthesia.  Injections can be repeated, but should be spaced from three to six months  apart to avoid exceeding the recommended dose. Botulinum-toxin injections  may be used in combination with other treatments.Botulinum-toxin injections are typically expensive and may not be covered  by insurance. A Reimbursement Hotline established by Allergan, the  manufacturer of Botox, is a resource for reimbursement questions: (800)  530-6680 or online at http://www.botox.com. Elan, the  manufacturer of Myobloc, also has resources available to answer questions  about reimbursement. Interested persons may call (888) 461-2255 or go  online at http://www.elan.com.Alcohol and phenol are injected in combination, but are less common  treatments. The medications are injected directly onto nerves that supply  spastic muscles to destroy them. The injections cut off the signals to  those muscles, allowing them to relax. This treatment may be used to treat  spasticity in larger muscle groups closer to the trunk, such as the thigh  muscles. Although this treatment is generally less expensive than  botulinum-toxin injections, there are more serious side effects.Short-term medications such as lidocaine, a local anesthetic, can be used  to assess the potential benefit of botulinum-toxin or alcohol and phenol  injections.CONTINUOUS DELIVERY MEDICATIONS Baclofen usually is taken as an oral medication but also can be delivered  directly into the spinal fluid when the oral medication does not  effectively control symptoms. An intrathecal baclofen delivery system,  surgically placed by a neurosurgeon, continuously releases prescribed  amounts of baclofen in small doses directly into the spinal fluid via a  small catheter and pump. This type of delivery system causes fewer and less severe side effects than the oral  baclofen.Pump refills and medication adjustments are generally made once every two  to three months after the initial dosage is established. The pump system  lasts from three to five years, at which time it needs to be replaced.SurgerySurgery is only recommended when all other treatments have been tried and  have not effectively controlled the child's symptoms.Selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery, also called selective posterior  rhizotomy, involves a surgical resection of part of the spinal nerve. By  cutting the sensory nerve rootlets that cause the spasticity, muscle  stiffness is decreased while other functions are maintained. Potential  benefits of this surgical procedure include pain relief, reduced  spasticity to improve walking or aid sitting in a wheelchair, increased  ability to bend at the waist, and improved use of the hands. Sometimes  rhizotomy results in improved breathing and better control of the arms,  legs, and head.Thalamotomy is a surgical procedure used to destroy part of the thalamus,  which is thought to produce abnormal brain activity that causes tremor.  Pallidotomy is a surgical procedure used to destroy part of the globus  pallidus, which is thought to become overactive with certain disorders,  such as Parkinson's disease. Although effective, these surgeries  have significant risks, including paralysis, loss of vision, or loss of  speech if the precise location of the brain is not targeted during  surgery. With the advent of a less invasive approach called deep brain  stimulation, these surgeries have become less common.Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a way to inactivate the parts of the brain  thought to cause overactivity or tremor in certain muscles, without  destroying a part of the brain. It is currently a treatment option for  adult patients with Parkinson's disease, but research is underway  to determine if the procedure can benefit children with movement  disorders.During the DBS procedure, an electrode placed in a precise area of the  brain delivers small, electrical shocks to interrupt the abnormal brain  activity that leads to symptoms. The electrode has four metal contacts  that can be used in different combinations. A few patients may have  stimulators implanted on both sides of the brain, but this increases the  risk for complications. The electrode is connected by a wire to a  pacemaker-like device implanted under the skin in the chest. This device  generates the electrical shocks. The electrical stimulation can be  adjusted as the patient's condition progresses over time, and the  stimulator can be turned off in the event that other beneficial therapies,  such as brain cell transplantation, are performed.Orthopedic surgery may be performed to correct a contracture. During  contracture release surgery, the tendon of a contractured muscle is cut,  the joint repositioned to a more normal angle, and a cast is applied.  Regrowth of the tendon to this new length occurs over several weeks  following surgery. After the cast is removed, physical therapy can help  strengthen the muscles and improve range of motion. This procedure is most  commonly performed on the Achilles tendon but may also be performed on the  knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, and wrists. Tendon transfer surgery is  another technique to treat contractures. During this procedure, the tendon  attached to a spastic muscle is cut and transferred to a different site,  preventing the muscle from being pulled into an abnormal position. The  disadvantages of these orthopedic procedures are that they are  irreversible and they may need to be repeated.Other orthopedic surgeries that may accompany contracture release surgery  include osteotomy, in which a small wedge is removed from a bone to allow  repositioning. A cast is applied while the bone heals in a more natural  position. Osteotomy is more commonly performed on the bones in the hips or  feet. Arthrodesis is a fusing of bones that normally move independently,  to limit the ability of a spastic muscle to pull the joint into an  abnormal position. Arthrodesis is more commonly performed on the bones in  the ankle.Other treatmentsTransplantation of fetal cells into the basal ganglia has produced mixed  results in Parkinson's disease and is being researched for  application in other movement disorders.Brief application (about 10 minutes) of cold packs to spastic muscles may  help ease pain and improve function for a short period of time.Electrical stimulation may be used to stimulate a weak muscle to  counteract the action of a stronger, spastic muscle.Alternative treatmentAlternative and complementary therapies include approaches that are  considered to be outside the mainstream of traditional health care. Among  the therapies that may be helpful are acupuncture, homeopathy, touch  therapies, postural alignment therapies, and biofeedback. The progress made will depend on the individual and his or her condition.Biofeedback training may be used to teach the patient how to consciously  reduce muscle tension. Biofeedback uses an electrical signal that  indicates when a spastic muscle relaxes. The patient may be able to use  biofeedback to learn how to consciously reduce muscle tension and possibly  reduce symptoms.Coenzyme Q10 supplements may be beneficial, as some people with movement  disorders may have low levels of this substance. Coenzyme Q10 is a natural  substance produced by the body that transports electrons during cellular  respiration, or the process in which cells get their energy from oxygen.Initial trials of cannabinoids, the active ingredient in marijuana, have  shown promise in the treatment of muscle stiffness and limb straightening  associated with multiple sclerosis. Further research is needed to  determine the beneficial effects of marijuana-derived substances on  neuromuscular symptoms associated with movement disorders. Researchers  caution that smoking marijuana is dangerous, especially since there may be  other harmful substances mixed in with the illegal drug.Before learning or practicing any particular technique, it is important  for the parent or caregiver and child to learn about the therapy, its  safety and effectiveness, potential side effects, and the expertise and  qualifications of the practitioner. Although some practices are  beneficial, others may be harmful to certain patients. Alternative  therapies should not be used as a substitute for medical therapies  prescribed by a doctor. Parents should discuss these alternative  treatments with the child's doctor to determine the techniques and  remedies that may be beneficial for the child.Nutritional concernsDietary guidelines are individualized, based on the child's age,  diagnosis, overall health, severity of disability, and level of  functioning. Specific nutritional problems, such as swallowing or feeding  difficulties, may be a concern in some patients and should be managed by a  team of specialists, including a speech therapist. Early identification,  treatment, and correction of specific feeding problems will improve the  health and nutritional status of the patient.A well-balanced and carefully planned diet will help maintain general good  health for people with movement disorders. Specialists recommend that  people with multiple sclerosis and other movement disorders adhere to the  same low-fat, high fiber diet that is recommended for the general  population. A diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables will ensure  adequate intake of antioxidants, substances that help protect against free  radical damage.Children with movement disorders may have different energy needs,  depending on their condition. One study indicated that ambulatory and  non-ambulatory adolescents with cerebral palsy had decreased energy needs  compared with a control group of normal adolescents. Therefore, a  child's specific calorie needs should be evaluated by a registered  dietitian who can work with the parents to develop an individualized meal  plan. The child's weight should be obtained once a week or at least  once a month to determine if caloric intake is adequate.A child's self-feeding skills can impact his or her health outcome.  One study indicated that 90 percent of children with good to fair motor  and feeding skills reached adulthood. In contrast, a lack of self-feeding  skills was associated with a six-fold increase in mortality (rate of  death).Maintaining a healthy weight is important to prevent the development of  chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure ( hypertension ), and heart disease.Tube feedings may be required in some patients with failure to thrive , aspiration pneumonia , difficulty swallowing, or an inability to ingest adequate calories  orally to maintain nutritional status or promote growth.PrognosisThe prognosis for a patient with a movement disorder depends on the  specific disorder. There is no cure for movement disorders. However, they  can be well-managed with the proper combination of physical and  occupational therapies, medication, and surgery. The long-term outlook  depends on the severity of the disorder.PreventionPrevention depends on the specific disorder.Parental concernsParents should work closely with the child's therapists and doctors  to create an effective treatment plan. It is important for parents to  communicate their treatment goals with the health care team. Parents  should take an active role in the child's exercise program and help  the child practice the exercises, as prescribed, every day.There are many tips to make the home and school environments safer for a  child with a movement disorder. An occupational therapist can work with  parents to assess the home environment and provide resources forKEY TERMSActive motion —Spontaneous; produced by active efforts. Active range of motion  exercises are those that are performed by the patient without  assistance.Activities of daily living (ADL) —The activities performed during the course of a normal day, for  example, eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, etc.Acupuncture —Based on the same traditional Chinese medical foundation as  acupressure, acupuncture uses sterile needles inserted at specific  points to treat certain conditions or relieve pain.Anoxia —Lack of oxygen.Ataxia —A condition marked by impaired muscular coordination, most  frequently resulting from disorders in the brain or spinal cord.Autonomic nervous system —The part of the nervous system that controls so-called  involuntary functions, such as heart rate, salivary gland secretion,  respiratory function, and pupil dilation.Biofeedback —A training technique that enables an individual to gain some  element of control over involuntary or automatic body functions.Botulinum toxin —A potent bacterial toxin or poison made by Clostridium botulinum ; causes paralysis in high doses, but is used medically in small,  localized doses to treat disorders associated with involuntary muscle  contraction and spasms, in addition to strabismus. Commonly known as  Botox.Bradykinesia —Extremely slow movement.Central nervous system —Part of the nervous system consisting of the brain, cranial  nerves, and spinal cord. The brain is the center of higher processes,  such as thought and emotion and is responsible for the coordination and  control of bodily activities and the interpretation of information from  the senses. The cranial nerves and spinal cord link the brain to the  peripheral nervous system, that is the nerves present in the rest of  body.Cerebral palsy —A nonprogressive movement disability caused by abnormal  development of or damage to motor control centers of the brain.Chorea —Involuntary movements in which the arms or legs may jerk or  flail uncontrollably.Choreoathetosis —Involuntary rapid, irregular, jerky movements or slow, writhing  movements that flow into one another.Clonic —Referring to clonus, a series of muscle contractions and partial  relaxations that alternate in some nervous diseases in the form of  convulsive spasms.Computed tomography (CT) —An imaging technique in which cross-sectional x rays of the body  are compiled to create a three-dimensional image of the body's  internal structures; also called computed axial tomography.Contraction —A tightening of the uterus during pregnancy. Contractions may or  may not be painful and may or may not indicate labor.Contracture —A tightening or shortening of muscles that prevents normal  movement of the associated limb or other body part.Encephalopathy —Any abnormality in the structure or function of brain tissues.Essential tremor —An uncontrollable (involuntary) shaking of the hands, head, and  face. Also called familial tremor because it is sometimes inherited, it  can begin in the teens or in middle age. The exact cause is not known.Fasciculations —Small involuntary muscle contractions visible under the skin.Fetal tissue transplantation —A method of treating Parkinson's and other neurological  diseases by grafting brain cells from human fetuses onto the basal  ganglia.

The  disease, which causes progressive paralysis, is marked by periods of  exacerbation and remission.Muscle spasm —Localized muscle contraction that occurs when the brain signals  the muscle to contract.Myoclonus —Involuntary contractions of a muscle or an interrelated group of  muscles. Also known as myoclonic seizures.Neurologist —A doctor who specializes in disorders of the nervous system,  including the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.Neurosurgeon —Physician who performs surgery on the nervous system.Nocturnal leg cramps —Cramps that may be related to exertion and awaken a person  during sleep.Occupational therapist —A healthcare provider who specializes in adapting the physical  environment to meet a patient's needs. An occupational therapist  also assists patients and caregivers with activities of daily living and  provide instructions on wheelchair use or other adaptive equipment.Orthopedist —A doctor specializing in treatment of the musculoskeletal  system.Parkinsonism —A set of symptoms originally associated with Parkinson disease  that can occur as side effects of neuroleptic medications. The symptoms  include trembling of the fingers or hands, a shuffling gait, and tight  or rigid muscles.Parkinson's disease —A slowly progressive disease that destroys nerve cells in the  basal ganglia and thus causes loss of dopamine, a chemical that aids in  transmission of nerve signals (neurotransmitter). Parkinson's is  characterized by shaking in resting muscles, a stooping posture, slurred  speech, muscular stiffness, and weakness.Passive movement —Movement that occurs under the power of an outside source such  as a clinician. There is no voluntary muscular contraction by the  individual who is being passively moved.Periodic limb movement disorder —A disorder characterized by involuntary flexion of leg muscles,  causing twitching and leg extension or kicking during sleep.Peripheral nerves —Nerves outside the brain and spinal cord that provide the link  between the body and the central nervous system.Physiatrist —A physician who specializes in physical medicine and  rehabilitation.Physical therapist —A healthcare provider who teaches patients how to perform  therapeutic exercises to maintain maximum mobility and range of motion.Positron emission tomography (PET) —A computerized diagnostic technique that uses radioactive  substances to examine structures of the body. When used to assess the  brain, it produces a three-dimensional image that shows anatomy and  function, including such information as blood flow, oxygen consumption,  glucose metabolism, and concentrations of various molecules in brain  tissue.Progressive supranuclear palsy —A rare disease that gradually destroys nerve cells in the parts  of the brain that control eye movements, breathing, and muscle  coordination. The loss of nerve cells causes palsy, or paralysis, that  slowly gets worse as the disease progresses. The palsy affects ability  to move the eyes, relax the muscles, and control balance. Also called  Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome.Psychogenic disorders —A variety of unusual, involuntary movements that occur in  children with psychiatric disorders or in response to anxiety, stress,  depression, anger, or grief. Psychogenic movements are thought to  represent the physical expression of an intolerable mental conflict.Range of motion (ROM) —The range of motion of a joint from full extension to full  flexion (bending) measured in degrees like a circle.Restless legs syndrome (RLS) —A disorder in which the patient experiences crawling, aching, or  other disagreeable sensations in the calves that can be relieved by  movement. RLS is a frequent cause of difficulty falling asleep at night.Rigidity —A constant resistance to passive motion.Scissoring —Involuntary crossing of the legs.Spinal cord injury —Injury to the spinal cord, via blunt or penetrating trauma.Stroke —Interruption of blood flow to a part of the brain with  consequent brain damage. A stroke may be caused by a blood clot or by  hemorrhage due to a burst blood vessel. Also known as a cerebrovascular  accident.Tourette syndrome —A neurological disorder characterized by multiple involuntary  movements and uncontrollable vocalizations called tics that come and go  over years, usually beginning in childhood and becoming chronic.  Sometimes the tics include inappropriate or obscene language  (coprolalia).Wilson disease —A rare, inherited disorder that causes excess copper to  accumulate in the body. Steadily increasing amounts of copper  circulating in the blood are deposited primarily in the brain, liver,  kidneys, and the cornea of the eyes. It can cause psychiatric symptoms  resembling schizophrenia.adaptive equipment that may be helpful. Some of these tips include:All throw rugs should be removed unless they are firmly attached to the  floor.There must be proper lighting. Nightlights should be placed along key  pathways of the home.The top and bottom of stairs should be highlighted with a contrasting  color or texture to distinguish them.The floor should be free of clutter, to prevent tripping or falling.Handrails should be installed, especially along stairways and in the  bathroom.All electrical cords and other cords should be kept out of the way.Raising a child with a movement disorder can be challenging. Support  groups are available to provide information and assistance.See also Tics ; Tourette syndrome .ResourcesBOOKSJankovic, Joseph J., and Eduardo Tolosa. ""A Guide to Movement  Disorders.""
