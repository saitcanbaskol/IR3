We possess a distinctive culture, a rare outlook on life, and truly unique words and vocabulary. If you're not a native, it can be a bit daunting. Adapting to the Acadian way of life may require a slight adjustment. It's not uncommon for new residents and visitors to mispronounce, and perhaps even misunderstand, the terms and words locals use.
