Re: Driving around Oahu perimeter1 Jun 2015, 1:37 PMNo road around the entire island. You can take the road on the west side all the way up to Kaena point and then it ends. Hiking is the only way to get the rest of the way. The same thing goes when you approach it from the north side.Report inappropriate contentdusty56438Saint Cloud...Destination Expertfor OahuLevel Contributor27,890 postsSave Reply2.
