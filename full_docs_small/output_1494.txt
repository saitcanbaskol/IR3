"If you have old ceramic wall tiles in your kitchen, it can really date the look of the room. Try covering the ceramic tiles with another material to create a new backsplash. Ceramic tiles can be covered over by several other materials, each of which can give your backsplash a fresh, new look.PaintOne of the fastest and least invasive ways of covering up ceramic tiles is with paint. Oil or urethane-based paints stick well to clean, dry ceramic tiles. Paint the edges of each tile first, then move into the center for complete coverage. Use an angled paintbrush for control, and don't cover over the grout joints. If the grout needs an update as well, use a special grout paint to cover the grout in a coordinating color. Seal the entire backsplash with a urethane sealer when you are done to lock in the color and make it waterproof.Tile Over TileIf the ceramic tiles are well bonded to the wall, it is possible to install new tiles right on top of the old ones. This technique works well in backsplash areas, because the new thickness of the wall won't be too noticeable. Use a cement-based thinset mortar to bond the new tiles onto the old ones. Beat the tiles in with a rubber mallet to keep them level and let the mortar set up for about 48 hours before grouting. Hide the edges of the installation with rail moldings or decorative tile moldings to hide the edges of both sets of tile.Tin TileTin ceiling tiles use a special glue to adhere them to the backsplash area, and this glue can be applied right on top of ceramic tiles. Use either true tin, or thermoplastic sheets and trim them down to the size of the backsplash. Spread the glue according to the manufacturer's directions - some will specify applying it to the tin tiles, others to the wall - and press the sheets into place. Smooth them down firmly against the ceramic. Both metal and thermoplastic sheets are textured, which will help hide the grout lines of the ceramic.BeadboardGive your kitchen a cottage feel by installing beadboard over the ceramic tiles. Use a thin, veneer-style beadboard; you won't be able to use nails to adhere it, so the thinner options will hold better with glue. Use a silicone adhesive and squeeze it in a serpentine pattern over the ceramic tiles. Press the beadboard into place and smooth it with your hand. Line up the pieces carefully with one another, so the seams between the sheets disappear into the grooves of the panels. Use a rail molding on the edges to hide the sides of the ceramic tiles.References  (6)Ask the Builder: How to Paint Ceramic TileThis Old House: The Cure for GroutThe Tile Doctor: Tile Over TileCreative Wall Covering: Thermoplastic Ceiling, Backsplash and Wall TilesFasade: Backsplash InstallationThrifty Decor Chick: Beadboard BacksplashAbout the AuthorSarabeth Asaff has worked in and has written about the home improvement industry since 1995.
