"Snorting oxycodoneAddiction BlogPublished: May 4, 2012ShareIf you’re thinking about snorting oxycodone, you should think it through and be informed about possible risks and dangers.Oxycodone harm reduction includes informing users of risk. Here, we review what happens in the body while snorting oxycodone, as well as the dangers and safety concerns when you snort oxycodone (addictive liability increases, as does risk of overdose). We welcome questions about snorting oxycodone at the end of this article, and will try to answer all legitimate questions with a personal reply ASAP.Oxycodone: What are you really snorting?Oxycodone is a prescription drug used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is an opiate agonist, which works by chemically binding to receptors in the central nervous system to change the way that we PERCEIVE pain. Oxycodone hydrochloride is the main active ingredient of oxycodone, but oxycodone tablets may include inactive ingredients such as butylatedhydroxytoluene (BHT), hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 400, polyethylene oxide, magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, and coloring agents. Oxycodone can also be combined with other medications such as acetaminophen, aspirin or ibuprofen, which you also consume when you snort the combination drugs.Get Help Today! Addiction Helpline Available 24/7.1-888-882-1456 Sponsored AdHow does snorting Oxycodone affect the body?Oxycodone affects the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. Oxycodone binds to opioid receptors in the brain, altering the body’s perception of pain and can also cause feelings of euphoria. This is the main reason why anyone would snort oxycodone. Physically, snorting oxycodone can also cause feelings of dizziness, lightheadedness, and even cause mood changes. But snorting oxycodone brings on effects quicker and more intensely and is not medically recommended (just like mixing oxycodone and alcohol is not recommended).Snorting Oxycodone side effectsTaking oxycodone orally as prescribed can cause drowsiness, dizziness, and even nausea and vomiting. Severe side effects are rarer, but can occur more frequently when the medication is not taken as prescribed, like when you snort it. These effects include:abnormal heart rateconfusiondifficulty breathingfainting/loss of consciousnesshallucinationsseizuresGet Help Today! Addiction Helpline Available 24/7.1-888-882-1456 Sponsored AdSnorting Oxycodone vs oralOxycodone is not medically indicated for insufflation (inhaling via the nose). And although narcotic pain medications can be taken orally, nasally, and even intravenously, oral preparations of oxycodone are safer, because the dose is more controlled. Snorting Oxycodone causes a quicker onset of effects, causing almost immediate pain relief and euphoric effects. But you’re also running the risk of poisoning, toxicity and overdose. Additionally, oral controlled release versions of oxycodone have a longer duration of action when taken orally vs snorted. Controlled release (CR) oxycodone is actually designed to work for over 12 hours, and when you crush an oxycodone CR tablet, you actually break this mechanism.Snorting Oxycodone to get highSnorting oxycodone causes large amounts of oxycodone hydrochloride to instantly enter the bloodstream through the nose cavity and tissues of the nose. This kind of immediate action is dangerous (especially with controlled release versions of oxycodone), because snorting oxycodone causes the drug to be absorbed in higher amounts than normal. If you snort oxycodone, you can abruptly stop breathing and can die. This is especially risky with extended release formulations. Plus, high doses of oxycodone might be tolerated by someone who’s taken opioids in large doses before, but they do raise the risk of adverse effects significantly.Snorting Oxycodone dangersSnorting Oxycodone has some serious side effects. Snorting Oxycodone puts you at increased risk of accidents due to your impaired abilities. Like other drugs, snorting can also harm your nasal passages over time, and even spread disease if you share snorting instruments. Snorting Oxycodone definitely increases the risk that you will become addicted to the medication. The most serious risk, of course, is that of potential overdose and death. Although oxycodone overdose amount varies by your personal tolerance to opiates, you SHOULD NOT TAKE single doses > 40 mg of controlled release oxycodone or total daily doses of of controlled release oxycodone greater than 80 mg . These oxycodone doses are too much for someone just starting the medicine.Snorting Oxycodone safelyOxycodone is not safe to take by snorting. The FDA warns that single doses of controlled release oxycodone higher than 40 mg, and daily doses of controlled release oxycodone 80 mg can cause overdose in those who are not opioid tolerant. In fact, the agency is so concerned about oxycodone being abused by snorting, that they’ve required drug manufacturers to reformulate the OxyContin brand, so that crushing the drug no longer provides access to the full dose of the drug. While this doesn’t completely rule out the possibility of snorting oxycodone to get high or experience immediate pain relief, it makes it harder for people to overdose using this method.Snorting oxycodone questionsDo you still have questions about snorting oxycodone?

Oxycodone, when taken in really high doses, slows down the central nervous system so much that normal breathing slows down. Taking too much oxycodone can cause your breathing to slow down, become more shallow, and possibly stop, depending on how much medication you have taken.joseph Tuesday, September 18th, 2012if someone has taken 10mgs of oxycodone orally a few times will snorting 1 5mg possibly kill them or is there enough tolerance built up?Addiction Blog Wednesday, September 19th, 2012Hi Joseph. Tolerance to oxycodone or any opioid develops over time, and the timeframe is highly individual. It's unlikely that only a few oral doses of oxycodone lead to increased tolerance for oxycodone and therefore dangerous and highly risky to snort oxycodone afterwards.Lori Saturday, September 22nd, 2012Hi. I didn't snort OxyContin, but a friend of mine gave me an 80mg controlled release tablet today because I have a toothache. I did crush the pill though.. And an hour or two later, I was vomiting. After reading some info on this med, I'm actually very scared. Will I be ok!? I'm afraid to go to sleep. Please help!Addiction Blog Sunday, September 23rd, 2012Hi Lori. Crushing an OxyContin breaks the controlled release and provides you with an immediate rush of oxycodone, enough to overdose. Good that you vomitted. I would suggest a visit to an ER, to be sure that things are OK. Or at the very least, a check in with a medical doctor.Steve Speer Thursday, November 8th, 2012I would like to share my heart to those inclined to addiction of this drug, and other pain meds... just how easily deceived the mind, the body and the spirit of the person can become. If you take these it is not the warning that ""you MAY become addicted"" rather ""you WILL become addicted"". As this article illustrates the whole outcome or purpose of these medications are designed to deceive the body, to mask/fool the pain, and sadly enough the thought or the idea that a person would dare admit to addiction is also packaged in deceit... denial is one of the greatest symptoms and the most dangerous, and should be placed at the top of the list. I have witnessed such destruction due to these drugs... I've watched chldren leaving the arms of their moms and dads by case workers... ripped from the security of their family crying and screaming for the arms of their mommies. I've seen young people rob their parents of any and everything they can get their hands on for the drug... lying becomes their truth and they know not the difference any more. Not only are the families destroyed but those friends around them also but the saddest of all is the violent destruction brought against the innocent child who has to suffer.rick clemmer Friday, December 21st, 2012Ive been taking oxycodone since 92. Im 50 yrs of age and have cronic pain not only do to my 5 bulging disks but for both of my knee's that were replaced, in 05 and 07. I had to take somthing tonight to stop the pain. Ive recently had both rotator cuffs done. When i had my 1st knee done, i did notice that i was getting addicted. I stopped for a week...... The pain was excruciating... im talking about the knee. The addiction was know better. Hot sweats and chills durring that same week. Im talking about , one minute your fine and the next your not. I do admit,,,, this drug spells DANGER!!!! The thing that saved me... is knowing before you take it and learning the side affects. Ive been an asthmatic since i was born. Ive delt with surups, shots, pills and inhailers. Luckely for me. I hate pills!! Im on a pain clinic plan now for my back, knee's and arm pain. Just last week i re-tore my right rotator cuff. Im not looking forward to my next opperation. Its going to be more painfull and take twice as long to heal. And all the side affects to boot. If you think its fun to take oxycodone and to get a buzz. Please consider this. I will be constipated for 4 - 7 days (without taken a dump) . Now thats a friggon blast!!!!Mahagani Monday, February 25th, 2013Yes, one more question. First thanks 4 the insightful info. after reading your answers about snorting pain Rx, it's no longer an option 4 me, however, can u please tell me what I can do, to not become so queezy, n constipated while taking it??? Crackers, or toast w/cottage cheese have'nt been working. Thanks AgainJunior Friday, March 29th, 2013Hey everyone, i first had oxycodone when i was 18. I was prescribed when i had my wisdom teeth removed, first time i took it i was in so much pain like i was crying thats how bad the pain was then i took it again the next day for a lil bit of pain, I loved the way it made me feel, i felt good and was up for anything good mood everything about it felt awesome. Then at work someone would always sell me Vicodins and loved it as well soon it became an addiction i dont go to the point were i steal or anything but now im afraid to stop CT because of my job i cant function without it, i dont even feel high sometimes when i snort 60 mgs of blues, i just want to feel normal and get my life back when i was enjoying my family without pills playing basketball, problem is i sell blues and have so much access to them. I NEED HELP!!Addiction Blog Saturday, March 30th, 2013Hi Junior. I think that many people can relate. You'll need to change the people, places, and things that you do in order to get off Vicodin. Also, look into inpatient or outpatient drug treatment so that you can get to the psychological reasons you use. Call 1-800-662-HELP for a national government hotline that can hook you up with local resources.worried mama Monday, April 1st, 2013hubby has been snorting oxy behind my back for a couple years (verified by friends) he admits to under 10 times lol due to a neck surgery he has a limitless amount but swars he dont snort now ofcorse i dont believe that but what can I watch for i dont want to loose him to this crap he is very good at hiding thigs from me so the obvios rolled up bills and lighter is never outAddiction Blog Thursday, April 4th, 2013Hi worried. Look for dilated pupils, which may be a side effect of quickly administered doses of oxycodone. Other than a blood test, there's no real way to be sure of HOW MUCH oxycodone is in his system at any given time. And set limits: if he snorts, are you ready to leave him? Take a look at your boundaries and get firm on what you will accept and what you will not.Deb Wednesday, October 2nd, 2013I am under the care of a pain management doctor. I have suffered from chronic pain most my life. I take oxycodone, not oxycontin. I have been sniffing it because by the time I can take my next dose, I need it to work fast. I was wondering if this has anything at all to do with non alcoholic fatty liver disease. There are other reasons behind it such as high cholesterol, being overweight, bad diet, etc. But I am wondering about this.Addiction Blog Thursday, October 3rd, 2013Hi Deb. Snorting doesn't affect the liver any more than taking oxycodone orally does. There have been rare cases of hepatitis and cholestasis have reported as the liver becomes inflamed from the obstruction of normal bile flow after use of oxycodone. But, from my reading, oxycodone is not associated with the development of fatty liver.Ruth Tuesday, October 8th, 2013Can snorting oxycodone cause problems with your teeth and gums?

I'm not sure; you'll need to seek the advice of a toxicologist or coroner. From my reading, stimulants can cause a stroke due to increased blood pressure and heart rate. But oxycodone is known to slow heart rate.

How much water is needed in order to dissolve oxycodone tablets10mg?? 70cc ??Jameyintexas Friday, March 28th, 2014I have a question about the effects of insufflation. A good friend of 20 years was snorting Roxy 30s. He had a brain aneurysm. He didn't tell the drs that he was snorting them. I'm wondering if there is a strong chance of that or is he snorting other things that he's not telling me about. I know for a fact he snorted the very large morphine 15mg. Do you think either of them is the culprit or just predisposed genetically.Some random addict somewhere.... Thursday, May 15th, 2014If God isn't ready to take you, it won't matter how much you use, you just end up in the ER where they will treat you like shit and then off to a psych ward for an ""evaluation"". Some addicts can't overdose even when we try really hard and use so called lethal doses of drugs and alcohol combined, nope, no luck, we just wake right up and walk it off like it never even happened. It just wastes good meds, gets you locked up and lands you with people who are actually dangerous and want to kill you in a loony bin. You don't get to peacefully drift off to heaven if you snort Oxy. It does suck being an addict. I think most people looking this shit up want to say how many pills do I need to swallow to die? Right? Is that the question? How many pills should I chop up and snort up before I'm dead? But that sounds bad so we present it in away that won't alarm anyone to 5150 us. Is there a safe place to talk about addiction? It doesn't feel like it. (P.S. For the constipated guy on Oxy, buy Phillips Milk of Magnesia, it's in a blue bottle, it's cherry flavored. Take two big swigs of that a day with water. You will go to the bathroom)Addiction Blog Thursday, May 15th, 2014Hi random.  Addiction does suck. And it can make you want to end your life. But there is a solution. Have you ever talked openly with an addictions specialist about what's going on with you?  I wish you peace!Random Thursday, May 15th, 2014Yes, but if you tell them what you really think and feel, they have you committed because they worry you will harm yourself. There is no one to talk to. You can't tell people you wish you were dead. Some drugs ruin you forever. Meth will ruin you forever and no amount of clean time ever restores you to whole again. I think the people on this particular site are just here to discuss Oxy which is an ok drug in high doses for helping you tolerate pain but probably not strong enough to kill a real addict. You would need a big dose of heroin to take down a real addict. A line of Oxy up your nose won't do it. It's a waste of time.Addiction Blog Friday, May 16th, 2014Hey again, Random. The people that can completely understand you are addicts in recovery. We've been there. We've thought those things. Have you connected with Narcotics Anonymous?Random Friday, May 16th, 2014Hi, No I haven't in a long time. My license is suspended from totaling my car when my blood sugar was too low so I don't have a way to get myself to meetings until the DMV finds my diabetes to be controlled and allows my driving privelages to be re-instated. I finally quit drinking and smoking so now I am dry and loosing my mind. I wish I knew other people in recovery.Grateful Recovering Addict Wednesday, May 21st, 2014@Random; I know its hard but you need to get to a meeting (NO EXCUSES!!) have a friend drive you or take a bus (there are meetings in practically every city at all times…..yes there are that many of us) Go to the main site: http://na.org and see when you can get there, once a the meeting all you have to do is just listen, and then just talk to the women there and they will be more than happy to come pick you up and take you to more meetings because one addict helping another is without parallel and we only get to keep what we have by giving it away. FREE YOURSELF !!!! FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE!! I can’t promise that it will be perfect or even easy but I can promise it will be a lot better than the crap you are living in/with now.new user Monday, May 26th, 2014I just snorted have a pill of 20mg strong release kind and it gave me the effects of being on oxy like 5 minutes after but really intense.

Advice pleaseHighTolerance Monday, September 29th, 2014I have chronic pain and have been suffering for years now. I'm on 10 mg opana twice a day and 15mg oxy 5 times a day. I have an extremely high tolerance and because of my age, I'm 29 my Dr's won't up my dose and I'm still n a lot of pain. My friend told me I should try to snort it for better pain relief.

I realized the last time I was out for 5 days and felt my body letting me know. Depression, sleepy, stomache aches, runny nose, not caring about work. I can admit that when I found more it all went away and I never want to feel that way again.

Help me stop?Ivana @ Addiction Blog Thursday, October 2nd, 2014Hi some guy. You can probably start taking it orally, and then gradually taper doses down. This would lower the severity of the withdrawal symptoms. But, just to be safe, talk to a doctor first.Dianne Monday, October 6th, 2014Please let me know if there are side effects with snorting 40mg oxycodone, specifically to the the respiratory system and especially to the lungs.

But there are general, underlying risks and dangers from snorting oxycodone. In regards of the respiratory system, they include: slowed breathing, irregular breathing, damage to the sinuses and nasal membranes, it can even cause your breathing to stop, which can be fatal.help Please Tuesday, October 7th, 2014I was given oxycodene from a friend to take for a reoccurring shoulder pain but haven't taken any yet because one I don't want to be come addicted and two I'm scared of what will happen to me.

I want to stop taking oxycodone but when I try to stop I wake up in the morning with my whole body hurting really bad and nothing gives me relief until around 6pm I finally give in and take 1 20mg oxy and that completely takes all the pain away and makes me feel better almost immediately I need help stoping. what should I tell my doctor that prescribes me these pills for pain? anything I should tell my doctor that he can subcribe me something to stop taking oxys? thank you and great blog.Ivana @ Addiction Blog Friday, October 17th, 2014Hi Eric. Your doctor can help you with creating a tapering schedule that will reduce the doses of oxy you are taking, but it will be done slowly and over time, so the severity of the withdrawal symptoms will be reduced. Also, your doctor can prescribe other meds that treat oxycodone withdrawal symptoms.Chris Sunday, October 19th, 2014I have been on Percocet (Oxycodone) since 2011. Before that I started on Vicodin in 2008 after an injury. I take 10/325 up to 8 times a day, usually snorted because of bilateral Rotor Cuff Tears and 5 Surgeries total on both. I also suffer from Insomnia and Depression and usually take 2mg Xanax and 10mg Valium 4 times a day (not all the time). SOMETIMES (not always) I take over the recommended amount of APAP and I am afraid of Liver Damage and Death. I am 50 and have a HIGH TOLERANCE for pain Medication as I am also on 80mg of Opana a day (40mg every 12 hours). Has anyone taken this amount of Percocet (over the APAP Limit) sometimes and been diagnosed with Liver Damage or Liver Failure?Chris Sunday, October 19th, 2014Eric, your concern is the same as mine, although I do not do that high amount every single day, just 2 - 3 times a week and it IS to be out of pain. I can't imagine childbirth pain if my shoulders and back hurt so much. I also have DGD and RA which makes it worse. Hope you (WE) get an answer. This seems like a great place for info. I saw other blogs and they SU*KED!Brandon Thursday, October 23rd, 2014I am not here to promote AA/NA but I do want to say that I went to NA for oxy abuse after coming clean. 4 days of the flu then a few days of depression. Hot showers , hyland restless leg tabs ( whole foods) , couple xanax and it was tolerable. I discovered NA was to chaotic and to many high kids coming and going almost like a high school party ( I am 34). I am glad to see them all trying of course. I then started AA and things got better quick for me. More meetings and longer sobriety. The old timers went through the same shit we are or went through except with booze. Booze is no joke when you drink until you withdrawal. I hear its life threatening unlike opiate withdrawal. Go to meetings, get a Sponser and don't leave until the miracle happens. I've been going for 6 months and improvement is happening. No miracle but better than day 1. It took 2 months to grasp what AA/Na was really about. Please try it. It may save your life . God bless you all.jc Saturday, October 25th, 2014sup i used to sniff two 20mg oxys a day i cut it down to only 10mg a day am i going down the right path?Boyd Tuesday, November 4th, 2014My son has been clean for some time but he confessed yesterday he had snorted oxy.

The best and safest thing you can do for him is to get him some professional medical help. Get him to the ER or Call 911.Amber Friday, January 23rd, 2015So.. I have been snorting oxys for over ten years now. I've been on higher doses, but I currently take 40 mg 4 times a day and also wear a 50 mcg fentanyl patch. I have ridiculous chronic pain in my neck, but the worst is my chronic headaches. They are a result of severe arthritis in 6 of the 7 discs in my neck. So... I have attempted many, many times to get myself to that place where there is NO PAIN. Several months ago I snorted about 45 30mg oxys over a period of about a day and a half. I had extremely severe edema, my whole body was swollen. But my legs, ankles and feet were HUGE; I couldn't walk. And I also had a murmur in my heart. How is it possible that this didn't kill me???Irish Sunday, January 25th, 2015How long would it take before a person feels these negative side effects? I'm assuming it would take only minutes?bill Monday, February 2nd, 2015How long does an oxycodone ir 15 mg stay in your systen after it is snortedElin Sunday, March 1st, 2015Hi, I have a question which no one seems to be able to answer including my physician. I have either asthma or COPD, not sure which. When I use (swallow) Oxycodone, my breathing becomes easier, if not normal. Any ideas as to why this might be? Thank you.Scott Friday, March 6th, 2015My son has been snorting oxycodone and I'm upset and scared..he is 12 how can be help himRob B Saturday, March 28th, 2015Hi Scott. Get your son to the nearest mental health or substance abuse clinic as soon as possible. They will do an assessment and get him into treatment right away. If he has just started, he can probably stop without too many withdrawal symptoms. However, if he has been doing it awhile, he will go through withdrawal and I am not sure how well a young person such as he will do with these. Indeed, at that age, if taking an oxy will get rid of the withdrawals, I can't imagine him being strong enough to cope with them when ending them is as easy as swallowing a pill. Thus, the assessment process can determine if he needs inpatient detox assistance. Yet, do not wait and do not worry about him being labeled an addict at such a young age. I know parents who hesitate to get their kids help because they don't want their children to be labeled, but opiate addiction is very dangerous and immediate intervention is necessary. I am have a Ph.D., but I am also an active opiate addict. Thus, I have first hand knowledge of how dangerous the addiction can be. Good Luck!Mallory Monday, April 20th, 2015I'm not snorting drugs or any kind but I have my suspicions about my mom's old bf and I'm worried becausemy mom and him have a good relationship. This helped a lotWorried Sunday, April 26th, 2015My best friend snorts Oxys and is supposedly cutting down to quit. I don't think she is and I'm trying to support her so she will quit again. She has done it before and now that she is a parent, I know she can again. I just don't see any real improvement, if anything now that she knows I know, it is worse. How can I help her?Mick Tuesday, May 5th, 2015This is my preferred method of taking my prescribed OxyContin. It gives instant analgesia, and as I am well tolerant, there is no danger (I am currently prescribed a third of what I was ten years ago). However doing this necessitates redosing three times daily rather than twice. So I am always left with a week every month with no OC at all and have to improvise with other meds.Lizzy Saturday, May 9th, 2015If someone snorted 60mg of oxycodone all at once, how long will it take to test negative on a urine drug screen? I have heard that the elimination half life if oxycodone is 4.5 hours and to test negative you have to have at least .01 mg in your urine sample. I have been trying to figure out how to do the formula to get the number of hours it would take for one to test negative after taking the 60mg all at once! Thank youMick Monday, May 11th, 201510 mcg? That is such a small amount you might as well say ZERO. Where did that info come from? You would require an extremely accurate and sensitive test to detect 10mcg in any urinalysis! Certainly the usual 7-panel test used by most institutions would not detect that small an amount of Oxycodone and they could have entered your system through as little as being in the same room as somebody who was smoking a pill or something. Do you really understand quite how small an amount that is? Take a grain of sand. Or salt. Crush it up. Find a particle, and you have probably got that kind of amount. I know people who have tested positive for all kinds of things that they (to their knowledge) haven't even been close to. False results, especially at these kinds of level, are not exactly uncommon. Second hand heroin smoke and marijuana smoke are most commonly found in these 'false positives'. Probably because these days one can hardly go anywhere at all without being exposed to some kind or another of either, being so common. Sit ten minutes in a room where somebody has smoked half a gram of Afghani heroin base a couple of hours ago and you stand a good chance of ending up with 10mcg/per... YOU DID NOT SAY IN WHAT AMOUNT OF BLOOD - and urinalysis unless performed with extremely expensive equipment which costs a lot PER TEST is not the most accurate of methods.Rob B Thursday, May 14th, 2015@ Mick. I do not know what places you hang out, but the idea that one can ""hardly go anywhere"" without being exposed to heroin smoke is quite the ridiculous statement! I am 43 years old and have never, ever been around heroin smoke. I have never ever been around anyone who used heroin except when working in the human services field. I guess if drugs and drug users are your lifestyle, then this statement might make more sense. But for those of us who do not run with addicts on a daily basis, being around heroin smoke is not at all common. Another concern about your post is that 10 mg of oxycodone taken within 2-3 days of a standard urine test will almost always show up. You are correct, it is a relatively small dose especially for many of us on this discussion board, but it is not minute and will trigger a positive test result in most people. I don't mean to critique you, but I work in the field and have a lot of professional experience with these types of things and would not want someone getting the wrong information.friend of a user Saturday, June 20th, 2015Will sniffing oxycodone long-term damage your sinus cavity & or cause sinus tumors? If so will they heal on their own after you stop using? Or will there be permanent damage?friend of a user Sunday, June 28th, 2015Jennifer I have the same question as you and can't get an answer.

We fight about this all the time he says that snorting the pills doesn't affect his lung, but he has been the the hospital once a month for the past four months because he is unable to breathe. Once he is in there for a day or two he starts to straighten upTodd Tuesday, July 21st, 2015Question for the blogger. I have been prescribed 8 30mg oxycodone a day which I snort, use 50mg fentinyl patches, and prescribed 3 40mg oxycotin a day. Went to the Dr for a blood test and it shows I have pertussis which I have no idea how. I've always been in top physical shape my whole life before my accidents which now been taking these painkillers for 5 years and for 6 months smoked heroin to bridge the gap when I ran out early many weeks which turned into just smoking H for that half year. But got off herion and back on my regular pain meds. Could snorting oxycodone cause pertussis? Or could it have been from smoking H? Maybe from neither but anything you can tell me about this would be great. Let me know if you have any info that can help.

Please consider that it is illegal to consume medications other than prescribed, and snorting is an illegal way of administration. Keep in mind that you put yourself at risk.Rich Thursday, March 17th, 2016So I have some roxicodone marked 244 and there a tad bit bigger then what I remember Roxies to be back in let's say 09'-10'. I know they're immediate release but after blowing 150mgs. I was left with little euphoria. I know they reformulated the OxyCotins back some years ago. Making them borderline indestructible and pretty much useless. Anyways here's my question. Did they reformulated these as well also? I remember buying Roxie's years ago and one left me decent , two left me perfect, and three was super noticeable to those around me. So, is there any reason these things don't seem as powerful as they used to or should I try a new method to help the onset appear quicker or nah?Julie Friday, April 1st, 2016I used to snort oxys and have quit and am getting off long acting morphine with the help of my Dr. I take everything as directed now .....However, I think I damaged my lungs from snorting them. I wheeze so bad and have a hard time breathing....it's been a couple months and they are just as bad. Will they ever get better?Closet Addict Tuesday, April 12th, 2016When I was 18 i starting having severe chronic abdominal pain with vomiting, severe as in screaming for hours on end and passing out from the pain sometimes, and no doctor could find a diagnosis. For years I avoided pain meds at all cost, my mother was an addict and as a child I remember her getting so high she would pass out literally in the middle of chewing her food and sleep all nght with food in her mouth, I would wake her up in the morning and she would start chewing. That memory stopped me from taking pain meds for years even with excruciating pain. However, I eventually gave in, and after 6 years of responsible narcotic use for the pain I was, unavoidably, physically addicted. Then I started giving myself reasons why it was ok for me to take the meds even though I wasn't in pain. I would think things like ""It's ok for me to take it now because I know it will hurt eventually, so I'm just being proactive"" By that time my tolerance was so high 6ml's of 20mgs per 1ml Roxonal (Liquid morphine taken oraly) would barely effect me. It's around that time I began blatantly taking it to get high, and would even fake my pain sometimes and go to the ER so I could get IV dilaudid. Despite all this I somehow convinced myself that I could stop anytime, and when my chronic pain problem was solved, surprisingly I did... For a few months. Now I buy my meds illegally and recently started snorting 30mg blues, and have gotten so good at hiding it I know none of my friends or family will be able to find out if I don't want them to. I'm afraid that one day after I have kids I'll be found by one of them, on the couch, asleep, with a midnight snack still in my mouth or worse, on the couch dead. Opioid pain meds have a mind of their own, they change you, make you abandon your values and change you into the worst version of yourself you can be. I wish more than anything I would have chose to endure the pain and stuck with my gut feeling to stay away from the meds. This is the first time these thoughts have left my head, no one in my life knows I'm an addict, aside from all of you now. Tonight will be the last night of my life I spend high, drifting in and out of consciousness, alone in my room with the door locked. I came here looking for a better way to get high, but I'll leave with the courage to get sober. Thank you to the people who were honest and shared their stories, you gave me the courage to say these things for the first time.James Tuesday, May 10th, 2016When snorting, if you mix Oxycodone with water, does it change how it will affect you vs. dry?sOMEONE SEEKING HELP Saturday, May 21st, 2016bEEN SNORTING ABOUT 2/3 OF A WHOLE 20 MG OPANA A DAY FOR ABOUT 40 DAYS . dECIDED NEEDED TO STOP THIS ACTION. 60 YEARS OLD. wHAT SHOULD i EXPECT AND WHAT IS BEST THING i CAN DO TO BE SAFE AS i HAVE HEART TROUBLE AND a fIB AND WANT TO REDUCE PROBLEMS IF i AM ADDICTED NOW. i BEAT hYDROMORPHONE WITH tRAMADOL. sO WHAT S MY ADDICTION ON A SCALE F 100 SNORTING 2/3 OF A 20 MG EACH DAY tHANKSLydia @ Addiction Blog Thursday, May 26th, 2016Hi, Someone.

Usually, oxycodone can be detected in the blood up to 24 hours after administration.Jc Thursday, July 14th, 2016I've been on these pain meds for 6 years. Started with shoulder surgery and 325-10 Percs. Was perscibed 90 per month. After 5-6 months I asked the Dr. For more. He quickly gave me 150 per month. A respected orthopedic surgeon!! I was hooked now using to feel normal over pain. Had a knee surgery 2 years after. Was perscibed 15mg roxicodone (greens) and 80mg ER OxyContin. After years I've decided to stop. But, you find out you can't cuz the withdrawals are so insanely terrible. You have to WEAN off. My pain management dr is awesome. I'm down to 10mg oxy (pinks) and 20mg ER OxyContin. Soon, he'll reduce the Mg again until I'm off. I do find myself crushing and snorting the immediate release sometimes when my pain gets really bad. It's immediate relife. I've been so tolerant for so long, swallowing just gets me normal, not ""high"" or out of pain. I will stop that and continue to wean. I'm skeptical of going the suboxone route so I'd rather wean and be done. I haven't lost my job or family, I have spent $$ if I would run out of my script early. I guess I've always felt that if I'm not hitting rock bottom, I don't have a problem. Well that's FALSE. I know some of you feel that way too. You have to admit to yourself that you have an issue. Then please find a dr. Willing to help you get well. Don't be afraid to admit it to them. They will help you. Best of luck to allNikki Friday, August 5th, 2016I snort oxycodone 15 mg, 5 a day.

Please help, I have a dr appt September 1!!Norwegian Viking Friday, August 12th, 2016I'm living with severe chronic pain and have been on various opiates over the last decade. Just recently I was put in Oxynorm 10mg capsules, and for the first time in almost 10 years, I'm totally pain free. It's a new world for me, but I hate the fact that I've got to hide my consumption of Oxynorm. I snort 10mg x4-5 times a day and have not experienced a single side effect from snorting. All the side effects I got from oral consumption of previous variants of opiates is gone. I know this will hurt my lungs and nose in the long run, but for some reason snorting seems to work a lot better than oral consumption. Might be because I've had stomach trouble from all the treatments and medicine I've had the last decade, I've got no idea. But I won't stop snorting because finally the medicine is working and I'm able to do normal stuff like keeping my house clean and help others with daily chores. I wish I knew why oral won't work on me, but I'm afraid of telling the doctor in case they label me as an addict. I'm not using any more than what I'm prescribed, and the pain I experience every second of any minute his real and from a previous trauma and following infections which went untreated for several years. I'm actually happy and pain free, I wish the doctors could prescribe some sort of nasal spray with the same effect, but I'm not sure if such a medicine even exists?  I wish all of you good luck if you're fighting an addiction. Stay safe and never forget to reach out to anyone if you hit rock bottom, you're never alone, even though it does seem and feel like it a lot of the time. /GuancheDillon Friday, August 12th, 2016Hi,, so over 5 hours ago I snorted 100mg of oxycodone on an empty stomach.

We contacted all the detox centers in Washington (where we are) and every one had the reaction of ""wow, thats A LOT."" They all said that she must ween her self to 70 mgs for 7 days at the very least before they can take her. She never had a prescription and her use has been recreational. The issue here is that she does not have access to oxy at the moment so weening her off safely isn't an option. Do you have any recommendations or advice on how we can get her through this extreme detox process on our own without access to prescription drugs that can assist her? Thank you.Lydia @ Addiction Blog Thursday, July 20th, 2017Hi Riley.

For prob 4 to 5 years now i have been sniffing them. I may just sniff a half to a whole at a time. Sometimes within an hour or 3 i may sniff 1 and a half. It varies. About 2 years ago I would drink sometimes too but then stopped drinking period. But 8 months ago I started having some drinks just one or 2 sometimes more or sometimes none. I have been reading the dangers of this and ive been drinking more lately..but now I am working on never drinking again but am trying to do that safely. In meantime i am still doing my oxy. After i safely stio drinking i am text to safely stop and taper from the oxy but that will b a slow taper stop so that I can do it safely while still being at home with my kids working, taking care of.my kids, daily life n daily chores, and without anyone knowing so I'm not.judged or fired etccc. It's been 9 yrs now tgat ive been on this prescription and many years of taking it wrong even. I'm scared now that something serious or fatal will happen while in trying to slowly stop it all just because I recently learned about overdose and statistics on all this! So my ?'s are.....with my tolerance and years using as well as the low amounts i take (sniff) at a time, am I at a high risk for overdose or death? Is sniffing 7.5mg or 15mg as risky as sniffing 39 mg? Or is it a little safer? Is sniffing that quantity safer than swallowing 30mg? I'm freaked out over all this now and I'm working on changing n stopping but its safer to do slow...but now I'm worried that in meantime something serious may happen even tho ive been takin this i.r. med for 9 yrs now. I know my tolerance is up which helps make it safer but i know ppl overdose and some die from these meds while using them correctly or abusing them. I just don't understand the difference or the saftey?? 9 years in and taking this correctly (6 15mg or oxy per day and swallowing one every 4 hours as prescribed ....could I still have an overdose or not)? But luke i said lately i take 5 to.6 in a day but i may sniff a half or whole. I may sniff half every 2hrs for say...is this safe? Or any dif from takin them the other way??Krista Sunday, August 20th, 2017Can Oxycodone abuse cause paranoia?Shirley Friday, September 15th, 2017Please help me,I have been on oxynorm for nearly 20 years as well as fentanyl patches and temazapan,I have taken these under the supervision of a doctor,prescribed to me from the pain clinic,I also used to take OxyContin,I have not taken oxycontin for about ten years,I am still in pain everyday,I just cannot carry on like this anymore,my son has never known me well but has known me tired fed up and just addicted to pain killers,I take 30 mg every 4 hours day and night,could anyone please help me,I want to stop taking this medication,I want to be free from drugs and need a detox clinic or something to help me,any advice would be a great help,does anyone know if I can go into hospital for detox,I really need to do this,please any help at all would be very much appreciated.

I have a friend who I worry about.Paul Friday, November 24th, 2017I had a contract with my doctor and was receiving 200 -15mg tablets for the last 8 years after a hernia surgery went bad and let me in severe chroni pain. Last month I had a elbow bursa sac removal and I told the surgeon I was already on paid meds and didn’t need any pills unless the pain was worse than I expected. Well it was and I also developed an infection. So when I went back to get my stitches out I asked for 15 pills to make up for the extra pills I took. My doctor is now claiming that I broke the contract and is going to cut me off next week, which I know will have negative health ramifications. Should I ask her to admit me to the hospital? It is not my fault I’m in this situation, I know I’m addicted but I feel not being in pain at least gives me some kind of normal life.

I blue my nose 20-30 times and a large clump comes out. Never bloody most of the time it looks like the pain meds mixed with normal snot. It burns once this clump comes out till I snort another pain pill. Why does this happen?Timothy Tuesday, April 3rd, 2018Oxycodone may be addictive. Not may, it is! However for chronic pain sufferers such as myself, if taken the correct way that it is prescribed it outweighs all side effects. I rather live with a reduction of pain, being addicted, then live in agony. For those that snort and smoke, shame on you as you are violating ethics and give responsible users like me a stigma. I If you must smoke then try medical marijuana. If you must snort then be the drug addict you are and snort cocaine! Leave my legitimate oxycodone alone! I am indeed a medical professional.Back to top"
