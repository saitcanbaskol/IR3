"Tuberculosis in U.S. Hits Record Low: CDCImproved screening of immigrants contributes to declineFrom the WebMD ArchivesBy Steven ReinbergHealthDay ReporterTHURSDAY, March 20, 2014 (HealthDay News) -- Rates of tuberculosis in the United States are falling, with cases at a historic low, health officials reported Thursday.Improved screening of immigrants has helped reduce incidence of the highly contagious lung disease, researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.""Tuberculosis continues to decline in the United States, and we are at the lowest number of cases since we have been tracking it,"" said Dr. Phil LoBue, acting director of the CDC's division of tuberculosis elimination.According to preliminary data from the CDC's National TB Surveillance, fewer than 9,600 cases were reported in the United States in 2013. That represents a decline of 4.2 percent from 2012 -- from 3.2 cases per 100,000 people to 3.0 per 100,000.But health officials aren't celebrating yet.

""We are making progress, but we still have a long way to go.""According to the report, four states -- California, Florida, New York and Texas -- reported more than half of all TB cases in 2013.Also, blacks and Hispanics have a rate of tuberculosis seven times higher than whites. For Asians, the rate is 26 times higher than whites, the researchers found.1 2 View All"
