"Thousand Islands9 best things to do in the Thousand Islands this summerUpdated March 16, 2016 at 8:24 AM; Posted April 28, 2015 at 11:31 AMCommentBy Cort Ruddycmruddy14@yahoo.com,Contributing writerThe Thousand Islands region truly offers one of the most breathtaking and surreal settings in New York, with islands dotting the lake and the river ranging in size from a few square feet to Canada's Wolfe Island, with its 48 square miles. Some islands remain wild and uninhabited, while others are adorned with Victorian homes and even castles. Along the shores, nestled into nooks and near deep harbors, visitors find quiet villages, like Sackets Harbor and Clayton, as well as lively towns, like Alexandria Bay, all regularly celebrating their enchanted surroundings. Here's just a few of things worth doing this summer in the Thousand Islands.1. Get Out On The WaterIt all starts with the water in the Thousands Islands, with countless bays and passages, as well as an international shipping channel. To fully grasp the beauty of the place, it's best to get on a boat. Luckily, there's lots of ways to do that including the many boat tour companies, water taxis and personalized cruises. Check out Uncle Sam's Boat Tours and Clayton Island Tours for group excursions, or 1000 Island Water Taxi and Classic Island Cruises for more intimate affairs.Boat tours in the Thousand Islands2. Visit Boldt CastleOnce on the water, it's hard not to be drawn to the beauty and mystique of Boldt Castle on Heart Island. It's harder still to forget the romantically tragic story behind it. Hotel magnate George C. Boldt began construction in 1900, meant for his beloved wife Louise. She died suddenly before it was finished, leaving Boldt heartbroken. Construction halted and he never returned. Now owned by the Thousand Islands Bridge Authority, and recently restored, the public can visit the castle via boat tours, water taxis or private watercraft. To be sure, Boldt isn't the only castle in the region. Also check out Singer Castle on Dark Island.5 awe-inspiring castles in Upstate NY3. The Antique Boat MuseumTo truly get a sense of the region's love affair with the water, and to check out some cool wooden boats, make sure to visit the Antique Boat Museum in Clayton. The museum's galleries include over 300 expertly-maintained and restored boats over 4 acres, with special collections focused on wooden speed boats, canoes and the St. Lawrence Skiff. The museum also hosts the 51st annual Antique Boat Show in the summer.4. Pirate Days in Alex BayOne annual event captures both the island vibe and the irreverent local attitude, and makes for a fun visit for families and others looking for adventure: Bill Johnston's Pirate Days. Held this year August 7-16, the celebration turns the streets and docks of Alexandria Bay into a living tribute to the renegade lifestyle. Performances, parades and even a pirate ship invasion take place during this annual celebration named after infamous local patriot, fugitive and folk-hero buccaneer Bill Johnston.5. Wellesley Island State ParkJust across the Thousand Island Bridge awaits one of the largest of the islands, home to small Victorian communities, summer homes and Wellesley Island State Park -- the largest state park around. Visitors can swim, camp, fish or golf. Or they can just hike along the miles of trails and stop in at the Minna Anthony Common Nature Center to learn more about the region's natural history. The park even offers two and three bedroom cottages for rent.6. Tour the Thousand Islands WineriesAnother way to get to know the region is by visiting the burgeoning collection of family-owned wineries. First launched in 2007, the Thousand Islands-Seaway Wine Trail connects wineries in Cape Vincent, Clayton, Alexandria Bay and beyond, making it easy for travelers to sample award-winning wines and get to know the region.Thousand Islands-Seaway Wine Trail guide7. Frederic Remington Art MuseumIf American Art interests you, it's hard to ignore that just 40 minutes northeast of Alexandria Bay, in Ogdensburg, you can find the Frederic Remington Art Museum. Known for his bronze sculptures depicting Wild West images - one of which sits in the Oval Office - Remington also had a passion for painting and a love for the Thousand Islands. Many examples of his bronze work and other art can be found at the museum.8. Charter a Fishing BoatIf there's another major activity that makes the region famous it's the fishing. The lake side is known to hold salmon, trout, walleye and lots of bass. Up the river, more bass, northern pike and muskellunge rule. There's no shortage of ways to wet your lines, from park access points to public fishing places. But the best way to do it is with one of the many experienced fishing charters that call the waters home. Bring a New York State fishing license, and you could catch a trophy-sized fish.9. Get under the waterA truly unique way to see the Thousand Islands is not on top of the water, but under it. Several local dive shops offer the opportunity for all levels of diver to see what lies below the surface of these amazing islands. With all the shoals and ships that have struggled to navigate them over the centuries, there's a lot to be seen. Launch a underwater excursion with one of these local shops: Blue Foot Diving, Hunts Dive Shop, Thousand Island Dive Excursions, and All About Scuba.7 best campgrounds in the Thousand IslandsView Comments"
