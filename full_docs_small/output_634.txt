And today we're going to discuss what CLA does for your body. CLA is actually a group of chemicals found in the fatty acid known and linoleic acid. And it stands for conjugated linoleic acid. According to Dr. Andrew Weil MD, CLA is an omega-6 fatty acid that's essential. Which means your body doesn't produce it naturally. Your easiest sources are dairy and beef products. And the average diet provides roughly 15 to 174 milligrams of CLA. And that's quite a range. WebMD even notes CLA might actually help decrease body fat. Just a word of caution though few human studies have been done with CLA and none have suggested that CLA delivers on the many promises made by marketers. Dr. Oz considers CLA the good fat you are probably not getting. Leading up to his reasoning for favoring CLA he explained to his audience that a fat cell is full of triglycerides that often get stuck. And when the body tries to remove them Dr. Oz states it turns out that CLA are like little gloves that go into the fat cells because they're healthy fats and good fats. And they actually go in there and disrupt the triglycerides that are already in there. And CLA breaks them up and makes it ready and easy for them to come out. Of course only time and further research will truly tell what CLA has to offer us. But there are already signs speckled throughout the scientific literature and they are all pointing to potentially great health benefits and a slimmer waistline.LIVE STRONG .COM Weight Loss ToolsFree Calorie Counter, Workout Videos & Diet Plans!Age WeightHeightGoalGenderSee My Calorie Goaladvertisement"
