"How is Body Temperature Affected by Eating?Fitday EditorNutrition Healthy EatingBody temperature varies throughout the day, depending on the outside temperature, your level of activity and what you eat and drink. Temperature can vary due to emotional and psychological reactions, illness and a range of other factors. Here's some more information about your body temperature and what factors affect it.Normal Body TemperatureA body temperature of 98.6 degrees F is considered to be normal. Most people have a normal body temperature of between 97.6 and 99.6 degrees F when the temperature is measured orally. Measuring the body temperature rectally often produces a slightly higher reading. Measuring under the armpit may produce a somewhat lower reading. Slight fluctuations in normal body temperature occur throughout the day, depending on a number of factors.Factors that Can Affect Body TemperatureThere are a wide range of factors that can affect your body temperature. Hot and cold weather can affect your body temperature somewhat, as can illness, physical activity, hot baths, strong emotions and agitated psychological states. Your body temperature will vary normally throughout the day as you pass through your natural circadian rhythms. Smoking, drinking and eating can have significant effects on oral temperature readings.How Eating Affects Body TemperatureEating generally leads to a slight increase in body temperature, as your metabolic rate increases in order to allow the digestion of food. Your temperature may increase by as many as 2 degrees F as the chemical reactions of the digestive process take place within your body. These chemical reactions are what produces the heat that causes a slight augmentation in body temperature. You can use Fitday to track your eating habits and how they affect your body temperature."
