JPMorgan Chase & Co led the ranking, with assets amounting to approximately 2.55 trillion U.S. dollars.The banking sector - additional information Historically, a key characteristic of the banking sector in the United States was that the industry was made up by a very large number of very small banks. These banks were supervised, regulated and were chartered at both a national and state level. Ownership of banks was restricted and investments in industrial companies were limited, as was the level of authority to provide customers with insurance, securities and property related services. The culmination of the last few decades of work has given us the banking sector we see in the United States today: consolidated and with an increased scope of permitted activities across the board. This has paved the way for the much larger banks with their equally large profits that are common place today. Show more"
