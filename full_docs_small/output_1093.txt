"How can your ear stay plugged after being diagnoised withâ€¦how long can your ear stay plugged after being diagnoised with otitis externa i was on oral and ear drops its much better but the ear is still slightly plugged and i hear like a hissing in the earShare this conversationAnswered in 2 minutes by: 10/1/2009Doctor: Dr. AbbyHello, Are you on any medications currently for the ear or have you finished the drops and antibiotics? Are you taking any decongestants? How long have you had the symptoms? Do you have any other health problems such as high blood pressure? Dr AbbyAsk Your Own Medical Questioni was prescribed a 5 day z pack and ear drops. the PA told me the ear was pretty inflamed and swollen and said it was swimmers ear. i went back after one week and he said it looked better like a 7 out of ten but their was still inflamation and redness so he put me on avelex for 5 days and said to continue the drops. it is 90% better the ear pressure and plugged feeling is much better but i still have alittle hissing and the ear is still alittle plugged. i am wondering if the first week i was putting the drops in the ear if they really got in because i would find it comming out of the ear. the last three for four days of the using the drops i could actually feel them go in the ear and it even stung alittle i am just not sure the ffirst 4 or 5 days the drops totally went inIt sounds like you had a pretty bad case. Often, we actually have to place a ""wick"" or a sponge-like piece in the ear when it is extremely swollen in order to allwo the drops to get inside the ear canal. The drops may not have been getting in your ears for a while. The steroids in the drops are what really help shrink the ear canal down. It can take a good 14-21 days for everything to go back to normal. If you are still feeling symptoms at the 3 week mark, I would have your doctor take another look in your ear. It sounds like you are progressing normally at this time. If you start having increasing pain, start the drops again and see your doctor. If you have any other questions, let me know.
