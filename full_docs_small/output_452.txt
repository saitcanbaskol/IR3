"AdvertisementScience >> Chemistry for Kids >> Periodic TableElements for KidsTransition MetalsThe transition metals are a group of elements in the periodic table. They make up the largest section of the periodic table located at the center of the table including columns 3 through 12. What elements are transition metals? There are a number of elements that are classified as transition metals. They occupy columns 3 through 12 of the periodic table and include such metals as titanium, copper, nickel, silver, platinum, and gold . Sometimes included in the transition metal group are the lanthanides and actinides. They are called the ""inner transition metals."" Electron Shells The transition elements are unique in that they can have an incomplete inner subshell allowing valence electrons in a shell other than the outer shell. Other elements only have valence electrons in their outer shell. This allows transition metals to form several different oxidation states. What are the similar properties of transition metals? Transition metals share many similar properties including:They can form many compounds with different oxidation states.They can form compounds with different colors.They are metals and conduct electricity.They have high melting and boiling points.They have relatively high densities.They are paramagnetic.AdvertisementInteresting Facts about Transition MetalsThe transition metal group is called the ""d-block"" of the periodic table. There are 35 elements located in the d-block.Sometimes the elements of column twelve of the periodic table (zinc, cadmium, mercury, copernicium) are not included as part of the transition metal group.Iron, cobalt, and nickel are the only three elements that produce a magnetic field.Chemists often use something called a ""d electron count"" instead of valence electrons to describe transition elements.Because of the their unique qualities, transition metals are often used in industry as catalysts for various reactions.More on the Elements and the Periodic TableElementsPeriodic TableAlkali MetalsLithiumSodiumPotassiumAlkaline Earth MetalsBerylliumMagnesiumCalciumRadiumTransition MetalsScandiumTitaniumVanadiumChromiumManganeseIronCobaltNickelCopperZincSilverPlatinumGoldMercuryPost-transition MetalsAluminumGalliumTinLeadMetalloidsBoronSiliconGermaniumArsenicNonmetalsHydrogenCarbonNitrogenOxygenPhosphorusSulfurHalogensFluorineChlorineIodineNoble GasesHeliumNeonArgonLanthanides and ActinidesUraniumPlutoniumMore Chemistry SubjectsMatterAtomMoleculesIsotopesSolids, Liquids, GasesMelting and BoilingChemical BondingChemical ReactionsRadioactivity and RadiationMixtures and CompoundsNaming CompoundsMixturesSeparating MixturesSolutionsAcids and BasesCrystalsMetalsSalts and SoapsWaterOtherGlossary and TermsChemistry Lab EquipmentOrganic ChemistryFamous ChemistsScience >> Chemistry for Kids >> Periodic Table"
