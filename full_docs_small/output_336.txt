"By Esquire Editors Mar 8, 2018 376Getty ImagesThese days, we drink mint juleps by the gallon as we watch horses with names like Good Magic, Promises Fulfilled, and Audible tear around a race track. The cool, refreshing bourbon-based cocktail is near synonymous with the Kentucky Derby. But back in the 18th century, the mint julep was an American Southern cocktail that denoted the provider as a person of means. This mostly comes down to the fact it's made with ice, and ice was hard to come by back in the olden days. It's also a drink that was once traditionally served in a silver cup, and silver cups were not exactly common among working folk.Luckily, though, you don't have to travel all the way to Churchill Downs to get one. It's a pretty easy cocktail to make at home. All you need is bourbon, sugar, ice, and a few sprigs of fresh mint. And if you really want to do it right, a frosty pewter cup.Ingredients Yields: 1 serving3 oz.               agave syrup bourbon5-6 mint leaves1 tsp.                sugarDirections Prep Time: 0:05Cook Time: 0:00Total Time: 0:05Place mint leaves in the bottom of a pre-chilled, dry old-fashioned glass or pewter cup.Add sugar and crush slightly with a muddler.Pack glass with finely cracked ice.Pour a generous 3 ounces of Kentucky bourbon over the ice.Stir briskly until the glass frosts.Add more ice and stir again before serving.Stick a few sprigs of mint into the ice so that the partaker will get the aroma.A few things to keep in mind for a truly great mint julep:Use a pre-chilled, dry 12- or 14-ounce glass, tall and slim (better yet, a traditional silver beaker).Crack the ice, making sure to drain off any excess water before putting it in the glass.Don't handle the glass with bare hands, as the touch of a hand kills the frost. Likewise, each julep should be served with a napkin or small linen doily.The glass will not frost if in the wind, if wet, with undried ice, or if excessively handled. You can sometimes speed the frost by twirling the glass or by placing it in coldest part of refrigerator for about 30 minutes.Use only the freshest mint and, of that, the smallest, most tender leaves.If you use a straw, keep it short so you can get your nose in among the mint."
