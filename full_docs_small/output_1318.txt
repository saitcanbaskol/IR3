(Electronics) a device that transfers an alternating current from one circuit to one or moreother circuits, usually with an increase  ( step-up transformer) or decrease  ( step-downtransformer) of voltage. The input current is fed to a primary winding, the output being takenfrom a secondary winding or windings inductively linked to the primary2. a person or thing that transformsCollins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged, 12th Edition 2014 © HarperCollins Publishers 1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2014trans•form•er (trænsˈfɔr mər)n.1. a person or thing that transforms.2. a device that uses electromagnetic induction to transfer electrical energy from one circuit to another, usu. with a change in voltage and current.

In the top transformer, theoutgoing voltage is doubled because thesecondary coil has twice as many turns as the first. In the bottom transformer, thevoltage is halved.trans·form·er (trăns-fôr′mər)A device used to change the voltage of an alternating current in one circuit to a differentvoltage in a second circuit. Transformers consist of a frame-like iron core that has a wire woundaround each end. As a current enters thetransformer through one of the coils, the magneticfield it produces causes the other coil to pick up the current. ♦ If there are more turns on thesecond coil than on the first coil, the outgoingcurrent will have a higher voltage than theincoming current. This is called a step-uptransformer. ♦ If there are fewer turns on thesecond coil than on the first, the outgoing currentwill have a lower voltage. This is called a step-down transformer.The American Heritage® Student Science Dictionary, Second Edition. Copyright © 2014 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company.
