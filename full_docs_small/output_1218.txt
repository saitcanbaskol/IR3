Crowned Eagle with Ververt Monkey prey Hugh Chittenden African Crowned Eagle 81-90cm wing NO DATA Africa's most powerful eagle, however it is very lightweight...avg only 4kg+ for females...probably the 3rd most powerful eagle White -tailed sea eagle bulky stout eagle.. 70-92cm, 66-89cm wing up to 2.4m, 2-2.45m, 183-239cm weight avg 5.5kg. 5.1kg, up to 7.5kg, range 3.1-7kg, 3.6-6.5kg African Martial Eagle 76-83cm wing 2.1m avg 5.1kg, up to 6.2kg Africa's largest eagle, however not as large as other eagles above...very powerful and attacks big prey for its size...the talons and legs r slim and long, a specialization for hunting birds, which r its main prey..rather short tail, like the eurasian sea eagle...used to be classified in a genus of its own (polemaetus) but changed to Hieeratus (hawk-eagles), and recently some scientist placed it with the Aquila (booted eagles)... Verreaux's Eagle a very striking jet-black eagle, not as big as most big eagles 72-90cm wing 2.1m weight avg 5kg, up to 5.8kg"
