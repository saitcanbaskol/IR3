One of the requirements is that students pass tests, or state-approved alternatives. Required tests vary by expected year of graduation. A student's expected year of graduation is four years after he or she enters the 9th grade. (For example, if a student enters 9th grade in the 2017-18 school year, he or she is in the Class of 2021.)State tests may be taken with or without tools, supports, or accommodations.

State curriculum specialists create tasks and questions that model good assessments and provide them to local school districts.National Assessment of Educational Progress  (NAEP): NAEP is a national assessment that allows educational achievement to be compared across states. Federal law requires every state to give the NAEP in reading and math at grades 4 and 8 every two years. States and school districts that receive Title I federal funding to aid educationally disadvantaged students in high poverty areas must participate in these assessments. Other subjects also are tested.English Language Proficiency Assessment for the 21st Century (ELPA21) Screener: The ELPA21 screener assesses the reading, writing, listening, and speaking knowledge and skills of students whose families answer ""yes"" to questions #2 or #3 on the Home Language Survey. The ELPA21 screener is used to determine student eligibility for English language development (ELD) services.English Language Proficiency Assessment for the 21st Century (ELPA21): The ELPA21 is an online annual summative assessment of English language proficiency. Reading, Writing, Speaking, and Listening skills are assessed and scores are used to determine continued eligibility for English language development (ELD) services in school. Only students whose families answered “yes” to questions #2 or #3 on the Home Language Survey and placed into ELD services through a placement exam take this assessment.Washington Kindergarten Inventory of Skills  (WaKIDS): This program helps bring families, teachers, and early learning providers together to support each child's learning and transition into public schools.The state testing timeline shows the history of how Washington phased in state testing."
