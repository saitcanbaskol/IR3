"SynopsisThe Monroe Doctrine was a US policy that was introduced on December 2, 1823, which stated that efforts by European countries to colonize land or otherwise interfere in the Americas would be viewed by the United States as acts of aggression. This doctrine was put forth by President James Monroe. The Monroe Doctrine asserted that the Western Hemisphere was not to be further colonized by European countries, and that the United States would not interfere with existing European colonies nor in Europe itself. The Doctrine came at the time when many Latin American countries were on the verge of becoming independent from Spain, and the United States wanted to avoid having any European power take Spain's colonies.Listen to sample songs Buy at iTunesBUY THIS SONG and full lesson packet"
