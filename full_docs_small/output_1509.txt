"Food & Drink Cooking & RecipesHow long do I cook a 2 lb pork sirloin roast for in the oven?Just wondering at what temperature and how long I should cook a 2 lb port sirloin roast in the oven. And what the internal temperature should be? Thanks!Follow 6 answersAnswersRelevanceRatingNewestOldestBest Answer: I'd go 350 degrees for one hour, meaning 30 minutes per pound. Let cool 10 minutes before serving to set the juices in.Source (s):home chefMARTHA D · 8 years ago0 0 CommentAsker's ratingPork roast is delicious if done properly. First of all let me warn you that a 3 pound roast is not very big so you will have to watch it closely or you will end up with rubber. I never do mine with a glaze. I would take 2 good size cloves of garlic, slice them in half or quarters and stick them into the roast it all around. I take a knife, stick the knife straight down and slip the garlic into the space. That's pretty much all you need. Do not add salt. You can put a little pepper if you want but I think its best to wait until its finished. Pork has its own flavor and can often be eaten without adding anything. Place in roasting pan with nothing in it, and cover. Do not baste. Start oven at 400 degrees and cook for 15 minutes (this helps seal the juices in) Reduce heat to 350 and cook 25 minutes for each pound + an additional 30 minutes so you need to roast for a total of 115 minutes or about 2 hours. About 45 minutes before roast is finished you can throw in some quartered good size peeled potatoes if you want. They will be done beautifully when the roast is finished. I do not recommend putting carrots in with roasts because the flavor of the carrots goes through the meat and everything tastes the same. With a roast so small it is really important that you not eat it as soon as you take it out of the oven. Let it sit in the pan (covered) for at least 20 minutes. It allows the juices and flavor to settle. Have with roasted potatoes and applesauce. It is the greatest comfort food in the world. Good luck. Geez, I'm hungry now.Lynn · 2 years ago0 0 Commenti would cook it for about 30 minutes a pound.
