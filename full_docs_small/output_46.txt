The presence of a drug or drugs in  urine does not provide information as to whether the individual is actually under the  influence at any particular time. Likewise, a urine drug concentration cannot be reliably correlated to blood concentration or dose.Blood testing, on the other hand may  provide more suitable information about whether or not an individual is ""under the  influence"", though this may not be conclusive in all cases.Urine drug testing accuracy is variable depending on how the testing is done. Drug  testing is extremely accurate and reliable when all aspects of the testing process are  done properly. On the other hand, the information obtained may be very misleading and  inaccurate when poor procedures or testing methods are utilized. Drug testing will only be  reliable when the consumer knows how it should be done and then demands from the industry  that it is done properly.Unfortunately, today, the majority of drug testing is poorly done and plagued with  unreliable information. Below are aspects that should provide enough information to  empower the consumer to demand proper testing procedures. There are three aspects to  reliable drug testing:Strict collection procedures;Proper Testing Procedures;Random notification.Specimen Collection: Collection of Urine should be done following a process of  positive identification of the individual and full chain of custody procedures. In  addition, and more importantly, the specimen should be certified by a means of temperature  measurement with a digital thermometer. Acceptable ranges of temperature measurement  should be within 96 to 99 degrees to preclude samples that are adulterated and or  substituted.Witnessed collections are not necessary and in fact are not as reliable as the digital  measurement of temperature within 96 to 99 degrees. (If witnessed collection is done, it  should also have the digital measurement done).Plastic ""temperature strips"" which are attached to the vial should not be  used to measure the temperature. Current widespread practice is for collection facilities  to allow temperature certification within a range of 90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In  addition, it is also common to use ""temp strips"" for the determination of the  temperature. These practices do not preclude adulteration and/or substitution of the  specimen and are probably the source of most of the inaccuracy and unreliability of urine  drug testing today.SAMSHA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) has unwittingly  encouraged these faulty practices by stating these wide limits (90 to 100 degrees) of  temperature acceptability within the regulations. This has fostered nationwide  incompetence in this area, allowing ""positive"" subjects to substitute or  adulterate their urine unchecked and resulting in indeterminable number of ""false  negative"" results.DDL's procedure for collection of specimens is available to any collection facility  that desires to improve their collection procedures.Testing Procedure:Ensure all positive results are confirmed by GC/MS or LC/MS analysis. This is critical to ensure no ""false positive"" results occur.There are two approaches to testing; cut-off type tests and limit of detection tests. A cut-off type test has an administrative ""limit"" set to report a positive result. If the drug is identified, but is below the limit, it is reported as ""not detected"".The LIMIT OF DETECTION - The limit of detection tests reports any detectable amount present within the capabilities of the laboratory. This is typically well below the administrative ""cut-offs"" discussed above. The most reliable ""negative"" test  results are those which are determined by a ZERO TOLERANCE testing procedure. SAMSHA  certified laboratories are required to adhere to established cutoff concentrations. In  other words, a specified amount of the drug or drugs is allowed to be present and still be  reported as ""negative"". This results again in an increased number of ""false  negatives"", or the reporting of a test result as ""negative"" when the drug  is actually present.To provide the most accurate and reliable information in a ""negative"" test, a  ZERO TOLERANCE test should be done. Require that the laboratory follow zero tolerance by  requesting that the detection limit of the drug or drugs be ruled out at the LIMIT OF  DETECTION of the GC/MS procedure. If the laboratory cannot accommodate that request, find  another certified laboratory that will. (SAMSHA laboratories will not perform zero  tolerance testing since the regulations require that established cutoff limits be  followed).Zero tolerance  testing may also be more expensive, but will provide the most reliable information if  testing is ""negative"" (assuming of course that the specimen was collected  properly).Random Call: Random notification is an important aspect of the reliability of  drug detection. The detection of any drug is subject to the timing and amount of the dose.  Subjects who have used illicit drugs may allow their system to clear if they have enough  time. The notification of the individual should be done so as not to allow enough time to  enable the person to clear the drug. Usually a limit of 24 hours is acceptable to detected  most drugs besides alcohol (ethanol). If ethanol is of concern the collection should be  done within 3 to 4 hours.For information on drugs, you can click on the following link to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ""Drugs and Human Performance Fact Sheets"" or view brief summaries of common drugs below.METHAMPHETAMINECLASS: Central Nervous System (CNS) Stimulant STREET NAMES: ""Crank"",""Speed"", ""Crystal"",""Go-fast"" MAJOR METABOLITE (S): Amphetamine SYMPTOMS/EFFECTS: Desired Effects: CNS Stimulation, euphoria, mood elevation, appetite suppression.

(Note: delta-9  tetrahydrocannabinol is the major psychoactive ingredient) SYMPTOMS / EFFECTS: Desired: Euphoria, Relaxation, Anti-nausea effect, Hallucinations General: Sedation, sleepiness, ataxia, and short term memory impairment. Physiological: Red conjunctiva (Whites of the eyes), increased pulse & blood pressure. LENGTH OF TIME DETECTED: Blood: Delta-9-THC concentration usually drops below 5 ng/mL within 3-4 hours post dose. Frequent users may have longer detection times. Urine: 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-THC (inactive metabolite) detectable several days to several weeks, even longer for extremely heavy users. THC is a  lipid soluble drug, therefore stores in the fat in the body and the amount of time it  takes to clear the system is dependent on how much drug was used and over what period of  time the drug is used. Delta-9-THC may also be detected. DURATION OF EFFECTS: Approximately 2-5 hours (route of administration and dose dependant)."
