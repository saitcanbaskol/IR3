When Keldeo learns this move, its form is automatically changed whereas Meloetta changes form when the move is used.Basically, you need to go to Mauville City and locate Crooner's Cafe. Just Fly to Mauville City and head directly south of the miniature Centrico Plaza-like tower. From there, make the next left, then head north and you should see a burgundy (brown) colored building; this is the cafe. Talk to the balding guy and he'll be glad to assist you.If my directions are unclear, just watch here.SourceHopefully I've Helped!answered Apr 9, 2015 by Sophisticlesselected Apr 9, 2015 by Hellfire TacoThanks!commented Apr 9, 2015 by Hellfire TacoGlad to have helped!commented Apr 9, 2015 by Sophisticlesi'm new to pokemon so hey guyscommented Apr 10, 2015 by willwhale0votesGo to Crooner's Café (located near the game shop) in Mauville City, there is a man who will teach Keldeo the move Secret Sword.
