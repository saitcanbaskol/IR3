There is an inherent tradeoff between freedom and the preservation of order through the construct and enforcement of laws. These attributes alone could be the subject of great debate. However, the United States and many other modern nations are experiencing a proliferation of technology that greatly enhances the sensory and capabilities of the user. If that user is the government, the debate over apparent intrusions into the lives of private citizens is amplified. The questions examined by this article are; should advanced technologies be used by law enforcement agencies? Is the government overstepping their Constitutional constraints by employing advanced technologies? Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of the uses of such technologies?Recommended CitationHeatherly, Michael C.. ""Drones: The American Controversy.""
