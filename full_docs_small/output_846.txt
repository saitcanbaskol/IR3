"Fact Buster (14 comments)Share PrintQ: Can a man's underwear determine his child's gender?A: No, but underwear can influence a man's fertility.Our expert: Dr Sarah MeachemPublished 03/06/2009iStockphotoHave your sayDid you change the type of underwear you wore when you were trying to conceive? Have your say on the messageboard below. Conditions of UseWhether you favour silk boxers, cotton y-fronts, or elasticised trunks, everybody has an opinion on male underwear, even scientists.But can the underpants a man wears ultimately determine his child's gender? And is there any truth to the tale that tight underwear produces boys and loose apparel leads to girls?Male fertility researcher Dr Sarah Meachem says there is no data to support this idea.""I don't know any quantitative data to suggest that you should wear one type of underpants to increase the likelihood of having a baby of one sex or another,"" she says.""If there was, I think everyone would be doing it, and we'd probably have an alteration in the gender ratio in different countries I suspect.""If you want to choose your child's gender then you are going to have to head to a lab. This is the only place where scientists can separate male sperm from female sperm to select the sex of an embryo.Underpants and fertilityBut while underwear may not determine the gender of sperm, there is some evidence suggesting it can influence sperm production and affect the likelihood of having a baby of either sex, Meachem says.Warming a man's testicles has been shown to reduce the sperm count, and there is some research suggesting wearing warm or tight underwear can affect a man's fertility.""Wearing tight underwear is not very good for sperm production because you're keeping the testicles higher in the body and they're not actually hanging at a lower temperature,"" Meachem says.""They need to be at a lower temperature to have successful sperm production. If you increase the heat of the testes, by having a hot bath, or keeping the testes close to your body, by wearing tight underwear, then that's not ideal for spermatogenesis."" (Spermatogenesis is the process by which sperm is formed. It begins in the testes.)Such effects are temporary, she says, but can last up to three weeks.There is also research to suggest that polyester underwear creates a lot more electrostatic friction, which can temporarily reduce a man's sperm count.However, Meachem points out that during the tight 'n' shiny '70s and '80s, when body-hugging polyester was in fashion, there wasn't a significant decrease in fertility.And while it is agreed that heat diminishes sperm production, one scientific study comparing boxers and briefs concluded that common wisdom has exaggerated the temperature difference between those two particular styles of underwear.So while underwear choice will not directly influence the gender of the child you conceive, it might affect a man's fertility.""Ideally, if you want to create babies and you want to have a good sperm count then you don't want to be sitting in hot water baths and you probably don't want to be wearing tight jeans or tight underpants day or night,"" Meachem says.""I'd definitely be voting for the loose cotton underwear.""Dr Sarah Meachem, senior research officer with the Sex Hormones Biology Group at Prince Henry's Institute in Melbourne, and President of the Australian Society for Medical Research, was interviewed by Annabel McGilvray.More Questions Â»email a friend email ABC Health & Wellbeing (14 comments) Share this article"
