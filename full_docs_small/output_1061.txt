"Navy Housing Service Centers Offer Rental Partnership ProgramStory Number: NNS130220-08 Release Date: 2/20/2013 11:48:00 AMA A AFrom Commander, Navy Installations Command Public AffairsWASHINGTON (NNS) -- Moving is costly, and for service members, the cost of moving to a new duty station every few years can really add up. Navy Housing's Rental Partnership Program, better known as the RPP, helps service members and their families save money on their moving costs associated with renting a home. The RPP provides service members with an affordable alternative for off-base housing and defrays some of the costs incurred as a result of their relocation. Benefits include reduced rents, reduced or no security deposits, and reduced or no application or administrative fees. ""Greater than 75 percent of our service members live in the community, and we are committed to providing them with services that meet their needs and help them save money,"" said Corky Vazquez, Navy Housing Program director. Local Navy Housing Service Center (HSC) staffs seek out desirable neighborhoods and homes and negotiate with landlords to enroll them in the RPP. ""Our Navy HSC staffs are knowledgeable of the community surrounding their bases. They are uniquely able to create and foster relationships with local landlords and property owners through the RPP,"" said Mike Bowlin, Navy Housing Services Program. ""Service members that take advantage of the RPP have confidence that the property has Navy Housing's seal of approval."" In addition to meeting landlord requirements, every property must pass a safety inspection by the Navy HSC before being accepted into the RPP. All full-time active duty service members, married or single, eligible to receive Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), are eligible to participate in the RPP. Service members cannot be rejected because of a poor credit history or score. The service member's BAH is used to match the service member to appropriate RPP properties; no additional income is needed to qualify. The RPP is operated at many Navy bases world wide. Service members are invited to contact their local Navy HSC to learn about availability of the RPP at their duty station by visiting Navy Housing's website at: www.cnic.navy.mil/Housing.
