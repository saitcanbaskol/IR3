"5 Harmful Types of BacteriaBy Sequoia 0 NutritionBacteria are generally classified as either helpful or harmful. Bacteria can be found everywhere, and appear on every surface and every part of the human body. The helpful bacteria are those commonly found in yogurt and in the making of cheeses, and are good for the intestinal tract. On the other hand, the harmful bacteria are those that you may be more familiar with, and are the very things that cause disease and infection. Here are 5 harmful types of bacteria that can be found in the world today.Type #1: Streptococcus PyogenesThe streptococcus pyogenes is the bacteria responsible for many of the common human diseases seen today, including mild skin infections and sore throats. The bacterium is spherical shaped, growing in chains and existing in the human body where the temperature is right for its growth. The streptococcus pyogenes is responsible for serious conditions such as multiple sepsis, otherwise known as toxic shock syndrome, where the body reacts severely to a protein produced by the bacteria. This type of bacteria responds to penicillin treatment, and is relatively easy to treat in cases where the infection is minor.Type #2: Escherichia ColiCommonly known as E. Coli, this bacteria is the cause of gastrointestinal diseases, diarrhea and symptoms associated with food poisoning. This bacterium exists in various strains, and naturally exists in the body’s intestines. The harmful strain releases a protein that causes the body to react negatively, and in the body’s attempt to purge the toxin produced by the bacteria, it reacts by vomiting and diarrhea. The best way to prevent the condition is to avoid undercooked and raw food.Type #3: Vibrio CholeraeThe vibrio cholerae is the bacteria responsible for the outbreak of cholera, killing many people throughout the course of history. Although cholera is now less common in the developed world, it still poses a problem for those who travel often to less developed areas. The disease is marked with symptoms similar to the common cold, including high fever, runny nose, vomiting and diarrhea. The body naturally purges the bacteria, and hydration is often sufficient to recover, although antibiotics are available to combat the disease as well.Type #4: Enteritis SalmonellaEnteritis salmonella is the most common cause of food poisoning in the developed world. This strain does not usually affect adults since the gastric juices kill the bacteria and prevent its spread. It does, however attack children and infants, causing serious dehydration and vomiting. This can be treated by a course of antibiotics, and with infected children and infants, medical help must be sought immediately after symptoms begin to surface.Type #5: Salmonella TyphiAnother type of salmonella, this strain is responsible for typhoid fever and is uncommon in developed countries, but a huge killer in underdeveloped ones. This form of bacteria releases toxins that affect the stomach and intestinal area, resulting in vomiting, diarrhea, high fever and bloody stools. Typhoid fever is very dangerous, and can be fatal for those who do not seek medical treatment after symptoms begin to appear."
