With a coastline of 536 kilometers (333  miles), Kenya borders the Indian Ocean to the east, Somalia to the  northeast, Ethiopia to the north, Sudan to the northwest, Uganda to the  west, and Tanzania to the south. Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, is  situated slightly south of the center point of the country.POPULATION.Between 1975 and 1997, the population of Kenya, which more than doubled  from 13.7 million to 28.4 million, increased at an exceedingly high  average growth rate of 3.4 percent. In July 2000, the CIA World Factbook estimated that the population stood at 30,339,770. With a current  annual growth rate of 1.6 percent, it is expected that this figure will  increase to approximately 37.6 million by 2015. The birth rate in Kenya  is 29.35 births per 1,000 persons, while the death rate is 14.08 deaths  per 1,000 persons. In terms of age structure, the population of Kenya is  relatively young, with 43 percent of all Kenyans aged between 0 to 14  years, 54 percent aged between 15 to 64 years, and only 3 percent aged  65 years and over. In 1997, only 30.4 percent of the population lived in  urban areas, though this figure is expected to expand to 44.5 percent by  2015.The population of Kenya is highly heterogeneous (diverse). Some of the  major ethnic groups include the Kikuyu (comprising 22 percent of the  population), the Luhya (14 percent), the Luo (13 percent), the Kalenjin  (12 percent), the Kanmba (11 percent), the Kisii (6 percent), and the  Meru (6 percent). There are also several other African groups (15  percent), in addition to a small population of Arabs, Asians, and  Europeans. With 38 percent of Kenyans adhering to one denomination or  another of Protestantism, and 28 percent practicing Roman Catholicism,  the majority of Kenyans are Christian. An additional 26 percent of the  population follow an indigenous religious system unique to east Africa,  while another 7 percent are devoted to Islam. A plethora (a large  amount) of indigenous languages are spoken in Kenya, though the only 2  official languages are English and Kiswahili. The latter, which acts as  the lingua franca  (common language) in east Africa, is a Bantu-based language with strong  Arabic influences.Like many sub-Saharan African nations, Kenya currently confronts an  HIV/AIDS epidemic of massive proportions. At the end of 1997,  conservative estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO) placed the  total population living with HIV/AIDS at approximately 1,600,000. The  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) argues that HIV/AIDS is  inextricably interrelated to issues of poverty. Poor women in urban  areas, for example, are often forced out of economic necessity to engage  in prostitution in order to survive. Prostitution, in turn, exposes  sexual workers and their clients to high risks of HIV contraction. As  such, any effective HIV/AIDS strategy on the part of the Kenyan  government will have to address the dynamics of poverty in addition to  gender inequality.TOURISM.With its beautiful coastal beaches, wildlife, unique scenery, and  history of relative stability, Kenya is the tourist hub of east Africa.  Indeed, tourism is the country's second-largest foreign exchange  earner, next to the agricultural sector as a whole. In 1995, Kenya  received an estimated 785,000 tourists with earnings of about US$486  million, a slight decline from the US$501 million in earnings and  807,600 tourists of the previous year. Earnings from tourism further  declined to US$448 million in 1996, though this figure still equaled  about 65 percent of the combined revenues from tea and coffee exports. Europeans account for  more than 50 percent of Kenya's tourists, while Americans account  for less than 10 percent.According to the U.S. Department of State Country Commercial Guide 2000, the relative decline in Kenya's tourism sector can be attributed  to a high level of crime, disintegrating infrastructure, the eruption of  ethnic violence in the early 1990s, and growing competition from  neighboring countries. Reassuringly, political stability has returned  and the government has offered various fiscal incentives to firms  operating in the tourism sector, thereby counterbalancing the negative  trends. Several multinational corporations are involved in the tourist sector in Kenya, including the Hilton  International (British), the Intercontinental Hotel (Japanese), and  Safari Park Hotel (South Korean).FINANCIAL SERVICES.The financial sector has grown considerably in importance throughout the  1990s, increasing its value contribution to the economy from KSh7,069  million in 1991 to KSh9,843 million in 1996. In terms of GDP  contribution, the financial sector accounted for 8.2 percent of GDP in  1991 and 10.1 percent in 1996. In the same year, approximately 81,000  Kenyans worked in the financial sector.As of the beginning of 1998, the highly diversified financial sector in  Kenya consisted of the Central Bank of Kenya, 53 domestic-and  foreign-owned commercial banks, 15 non-bank financial institutions, 2  mortgage finance companies, 4 building societies, and numerous insurance  companies and other specialized financial institutions. The banking  sector is dominated by 4 large banks, which aggregately control 50  percent of all bank assets and 52 percent of bank deposits. The largest  bank, the state-owned Kenya Commercial Bank, accounts for 17 percent of  bank assets and 18 percent of bank deposits. The multinational Barclays  Bank, with 16 percent of bank assets and 15 percent of bank deposits, is  next in line, followed by the state-owned National Bank of Kenya and the  multinational Standard Chartered Bank, each respectively boasting 8  percent of bank assets and 9 percent of bank deposits.The Nairobi Stock Exchange, which handles 61 listed firms, was  established in 1954. In January 1995, the stock market, including  stock-brokerage, was opened up for foreign direct participation,  although there is a 40 percent limit on foreign ownership. Market capitalization has recently manifested considerable growth, increasing from US$1.89  billion in 1995 to US$2.08 billion in 1998.DEPENDENCIESKenya has no territories or colonies.BIBLIOGRAPHYHimbara, David.
