Through the most jaded political lens, it could be considered a play for Virginia's coveted swing-state votes in the general election--but we know the former governor isn't looking that far ahead just yet.Filled out my bracket last night.

The nationally known governor throws a potential bone to Iowa voters, picking Northern Iowa to upset Louisville in the second round.Gov. Bobby Jindal's NCAA bracket: LSU all the way pic.twitter.com/K6znEBUcR3— Chris Good (@c_good) March 19, 2015LINDSEY GRAHAM -- KENTUCKYStaying true to his Southern roots, the South Carolina senator sends two teams from his neighboring state, North Carolina, and two teams from Kentucky to the Final Four. In the end he puts all his faith in the state of Kentucky--home of a potential 2016 rival and fellow senator, Rand Paul--and has Kentucky and Louisville playing for the title, with Kentucky winning it all.. @LindseyGrahamSC 's favoring 2 states in the NCAA Tournament, w/ 2 Kentucky teams & 2 NC teams in his #FinalFourpic.twitter.com/lB3AttO2LL— A.J. Feather (@AJFeather) March 19, 2015SCOTT WALKER -- WISCONSINUnsurprisingly, Gov. Walker chose his home-state team to win the tournament. But he also stays true to the Midwest, and possibly makes a play for the hearts and minds of Iowans, by putting the Iowa State Cyclones in his Final Four.MARTIN O'MALLEY -- MARYLANDStaying true to his state, the former Democratic governor of Maryland -- and the lone Democrat participating on our bracket challenge--Martin O’Malley picked the Maryland Terrapins to win it all.@GovernorOMalley staying true to his state roots, picks @umterps to win it all. #MarchMadness#MarchMadnessBracketpic.twitter.com/aSOFQrGIgw— Veronica Strac (@VeronicaStrac) March 19, 2015BEN CARSON -- KENTUCKYThe neurosurgeon played it safe and showed a steady hand in sticking with top-seeded picks to make it to the Final Four. The potential Republican candidate is going with the heavily favored Kentucky Wildcats as his champion.CARLY FIORINA -- VIRGINIAThe one-time Senate candidate and former Hewlett-Packard CEO puts her numbers game to the test with carefully calculated picks. Baylor is the lowest seed she sends to the Final Four, with UVA winning it all.TED CRUZ -- KENTUCKYAlthough the Texan senator tweeted out a congratulations to all the Texas teams that made the tournament, Cruz opted out of picking any of his home-state teams to reach the Final Four. Cruz also sided with sports analysts and picked the undefeated Wildcats as the winner.JOHN BOLTON -- KENTUCKYThe former U.N. ambassador puts his geopolitical pragmatism to use in this bracket that includes three one-seeds and a two-seed in the Final Four. A Yale alumn, Bolton picks his alma mater's rival, Harvard, to win its first-round game.JIM GILMORE -- VIRGINIAThe former Virginia governor picks a homer bracket, with his home state's UVA team going all the way. Gilmore makes the popular selection of putting Iowa State in the Final Four.Virginia Gov. @GovernorGilmore picks his home state's team UVA for the win: #marchmadnesspic.twitter.com/JBkzt4dRLN— Stacy Chen (@stacyytchen) March 19, 2015RICK SANTORUM -- WISCONSINThe former senator and onetime GOP presidential runner-up played it safe, carefully picking the higher seeds in most games. However, like other possible 2016 hopefuls, he does appear to be favoring Iowa -- whose caucuses he won in 2012 -- putting the Cyclones in the Final Four. He also made sure to represent Pennsylvania, with Villanova also reaching the semifinal round.BOB EHRLICH -- KENTUCKYThe former Maryland governor sticks with the frontrunner in this field, picking the Wildcats over Duke in the title game. Ehrlich might be an early underdog to the 2016 frontrunners if he enters the race, and he likes some upsets in the tournament this year, with UCLA and Davidson both advancing.GEORGE PATAKI -- KENTUCKYIn what could be construed as a naked play for support from Iowa caucusgoers, the savvy former New York governor has Iowa State reaching the title game, before the overwhelming odds prevail with a Kentucky victory in Gov. Pataki's bracket.MIKE HUCKABEE -- ARKANSASLast, but certainly not least, the 12-seed darling of the 2008 presidential race declined to submit an actual, pool-worthy bracket, but he shows out for his home state of Arkansas with what might be the biggest homer NCAA bracket ever tweeted.Just filled out my bracket for the NCAA tournament. Pretty sure I nailed it. #gohogsgo #woopigsooiepic.twitter.com/vUE5cZ2qgx— Gov.
