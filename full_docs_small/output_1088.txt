"While the media is busy smearing President Donald Trump, he continues to speak directly to the American people. That’s because we know the truth… and they would never report THIS story!But this story is extraordinary! In Los Angeles, an airline was refusing to help get a sick 3-year-old Jewish boy on a flight.Trump was called, and he immediately made his expensive private jet available. Donald Trump acted to save the day, without hesitation.THIS is what a REAL leader looks like.The private Boeing 727 of real estate tycoon Donald Trump arrived from Los Angeles at LaGuardia Airport Tuesday morning, carrying aboard an Orthodox Jewish child with a rare and still undiagnosed breathing illness.The child, Andrew Ten, age 3, arrived with his parents — accompanied by three nurses who attend to him around the clock — to try to seek medical help in the New York area.Trump made his plane available for the special trip to New York after the boy’s parents, Judy and Harold Ten, called Trump and told him of their plight.Commercial airlines refused to fly the child because he could not travel without an elaborate life-support system, which includes a portable oxygen tank, a suction machine, a breathing bag and an adrenaline syringe.“Mr. Trump did not hesitate when we called him up. He said ‘yes, I’ll send my plane out,’” 29-year-old Harold Ten recalled shortly after he landed here Tuesday morning.Asked why he thought Trump made his private jet available, Ten replied, “Because he is a good man. He has three children of his own and he knows what being a parent is all about.”While Donald Trump is busy saving young boys at airports, President Barack Obama allows his family to live in poverty somewhere in Kenya.Thank you Donald Trump for setting such an example for the rest of us!
