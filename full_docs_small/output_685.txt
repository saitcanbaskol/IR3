"Renters: 7 Things To Do Before Moving OutBeth ZeiglerJan 19, 2010Share EmailGetting the deposit back after moving is something we always look forward to. To us, it's kinda like ""found money"" and can be quite useful to balance out moving costs. Here are 7 things we do before moving out which helps ensure our deposit check is in the mail.Patch up holes Once you've taken your artwork down, remove nails and screws and patch with spackling paste. Don't forget to sand each spot for a smooth wall that your landlord can easily paint over. Repaint This all depends on your landlord, the lease and what both parties agreed to when you first moved in. But if you weren't supposed to paint or you agreed to repaint when you moved out, unfortunately you'll have to tackle this big chore. We like to have ""painting parties"" and get friends involved or hire day laborers for a budget friendly option. Clean out the oven and fridge We always like to leave the apartment how we found it (which means cleaning the oven and the fridge). Schedule these tasks at least a month to two weeks before you move since they can be time consuming. You can line the oven with tinfoil to protect it from future spills. Clean Don't forget to give the apartment a good cleaning after everything has been moved out. Since we can barely stomach mopping after a long day of moving all our belongings out, we usually indulge in a cleaning service. Leave an empty apartment You may think you're doing the landlord or future tenants a favor by leaving a spare broom or baking soda but it's best to donate/recycle/toss any belongings that you don't plan on taking with you. Round-up the keys Don't forget to gather all the keys to your apartment building (even the spare set that you had made for the neighbors). Plan a walk-through Schedule a time for you and your landlord to walk through the apartment building. This will give you a chance to show your landlord that you've taken care of everything and ensure that the deposit check will be returned.Related Posts7 Things To Do Before You Move In10 Questions To Ask Before You Sign A LeaseWhat Makes For A Qualified Renter (Image: Beth Zeigler)Apartment Therapy supports our readers with carefully chosen product recommendations to improve life at home.

You'll need if your landlord is a jerk and tries to keep your deposit. I too, leave TP, mostly for the use of the people doing the moving out, namely me. Paper towels, too.FlagReplyAngelgirl50 4 years agoI feel sorry for the elderly renters is one of our Apartment Complex. A friend of mine moved out, cleaned everything from top to bottom, gave the keys to the Manager. His mistake was not to wait for a walkthrough with the manager or not making pictures after cleaning. The maintness person staged the apartment that is looked dirty and made pictures of is. My friend did not get the deposit back and was charged on top of it for cleaning. Manager also did not take both sets of keys back, saying we only need the original set. But he was than charged for the second set anyway. So before you move out and you know your apartment is clean, make pictures, have a walk through, let management sign for the keys you give back!!!!FlagReplyBostonBean 5 years agoToothpaste? Are you freaking kidding me? I'm a landlord, and I would totally withhold money from a security deposit if a tenant did this. I specifically inform tenants (in writing, as part of the move-out instructions) to NOT remove picture hooks/nails/etc. from the walls. Why? Because they are likely to do MORE damage in the process (one tenant didn't have a screwdriver handy, so he used a butter knife to dig molly bolts out of the plaster walls). Really, it's easier for me to find the holes if the picture hook or nail is still there, and I can patch the hole properly. Painting/re-painting is also a huge no-no in my book. Tenants generally don't have the proper equipment (drop cloths, etc.) or skill and can make a bigger mess of things than they started with. Most of the time, I'm going to have to re-do it anyway; I'd rather not have multiple layers of paint if I can avoid it. When in doubt, ASK the landlord what you should (or shouldn't) do before you move out. Don't forget to replace any burned out light bulbs, too. The only things I can emphatically agree with on this list are CLEAN EVERYTHING and LEAVE THE APARTMENT EMPTY. Yes, including the toilet paper - when I re-rent, I supply a wrapped roll or two along with a new shower curtain and paper towels in the kitchen. I charge about $30/hour for cleaning, so it can whittle away the security deposit pretty quickly if the place is left a mess. And, yes, Pencils, it really is the exceptional tenant that cleans and moves everything out. Which is why I am happy to forgive pretty much everything else as ""normal wear and tear"" when they do.FlagReplyShow 39 more commentsJoin the Conversation!Enter your email to sign in or to create an accountNextNeed help?
