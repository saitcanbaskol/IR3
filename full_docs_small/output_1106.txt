"Snap Schedule employee scheduling software takes the pain out of creating work schedules  and controlling labor budgets for retail and wholesale companies. It offers several different work schedule views  designed to accommodate a variety of scheduling styles and processes.Employee scheduling and rostering for retail can be complicated and present many challenges. Retail businesses have peak hours, high seasons and a variety of job positions to schedule and shifts to cover. Retail managers are usually given labor budgets (payroll dollars) that generally vary from week to week as retail store sales fluctuate. Union and FLSA rules may place restrictions on work hours, overtime compensation, and the types of work schedules that can be implemented. Retail managers must also consider time-off requests, labor rules, and personnel availabilities when developing schedules for full-time and part-time workers.With Snap Schedule employee scheduling software, retail and wholesale companies like department stores, hardware stores, home improvement stores, grocery stores, convenience stores, supermarkets, warehouses, landscaping and nurseries, gas stations, etc. will cut scheduling time, improve efficiency, reduce labor costs, and strike a work-life balance for employees.Using spreadsheets, documents, online calendars, or paper to schedule retail workers may be familiar. Perhaps it’s the way your organization has always done personnel scheduling. While these methods may be sliding by, they lack the capabilities and features needed to increase efficiency, reduce labor costs, and promote employee work-life balance.See How It WorksSnap Schedule 365 - Introduction for Schedulers and ManagersYour browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available.
