"SPEECH THERAPY ON THE HORSELife Spirit Speech Hippotherapy offers a unique opportunity and a multitude of benefits geared to meet the distinctive needs of each individual. Our hippotherapy program is offered at the J.F. Shea Therapeutic Riding Center in San Juan Capistrano.The smiles and joy observed when individuals are offered the opportunity to interact and benefit from the relationship with our horses is powerful and healing! Therapeutic riding programs have been helping people in the United States and around the world since the 1950’s.Our method is to utilize the horses movement creating sensation of the sensory domains (visual, auditory, tactile, vestibular, proprioceptive). This input directs the rider into an optimal arousal state. The rider is more focused towards the intervention process than traditional clinical treatments. Behavior struggles are most often eliminated during the therapeutic process.Having Fun!!Speech Therapy Utilizing Equine MovementProgram Goals & Benefits1) Increase muscle strength to allow speech production.2) Encourage ones’ sense of accomplishment and self-esteem.3) Support a sense of safety awareness.4) Learning about the needs of the horses encourage participant’s to observe the needs of others.5) Enhance sensory acceptance, body awareness, motor planning, posture, and muscle strength.6) Encourage appropriate attention to tasks.7) Increase positive behavioral interactive skills.8) Advance and encourage reciprocal interaction and social interactive skills, peer interaction and building friendships.9) Increase one’s alertness and ability to interpret non-verbal communication signals while communicating with the horse and the instructors.10) Stimulate and encourage auditory comprehension skill growth.11) Increase the development of oral language skills.12) Add to, and strengthen overall communication skills.Our speech language pathologist will conduct an initial evaluation in order to determine if a hippotherapy program is suited for the participant.
