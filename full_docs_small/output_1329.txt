On the list was a light-hearted dig at Maroon 5's song 'Moves Like Jagger' featuring Christina Aguilera, the video of which begins with footage of Jagger in his younger years and later shows singer Adam Levine trying out some of the famous dance moves. Jagger had written on his list that he had learned that ""You don't earn a cent when someone does a song about having moves like Jagger."" The music legend also drew laughs from his other advice which included, ""Be considerate of other hotel guests - trash your room by 10 pm"" and, ""Before shouting 'Hi Seattle!' make sure you're in Seattle.""'Moves Like Jagger' is not the first number one hit that has referenced the star; he has also been mentioned in Ke$ha's 'TiK ToK' ('We kick em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger') and Cher Lloyd 's 'Swagger Jagger'.ContactmusicFollow Mick Jagger"
