By week 16, the treatment group’s mean acne lesion count had dropped to 3.2 from a mean baseline of 10.6. Following an additional 16 weeks of open-label therapy, the acne lesion count in patients in the treatment arm had fallen to 1.3.In patients who received placebo, the mean acne lesion count did not change significantly over the first 16 weeks; however, when treated over the subsequent open-label 16-week period, the control group’s acne count fell to 3.9.""Isotretinoin seems to me to be just as valuable a treatment in adults as in teenagers,"" co-investigator Steven R. Feldman, M.D., professor of dermatology, Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, is quoted by Ob.Gyn.News as saying. ""My standard approach is to use it in the same way, though using it in lower doses for longer periods of time is reasonable and often effective with fewer side effects.""Go back to the Dermatology Times eNews newsletter.TagsModern Medicine Feature Articles Welcome to ModernMedicine DermatologyHeather OnoratiHeather Onorati is the Channel Content Director for Dermatology Times and Cosmetic Surgery Times.More"
