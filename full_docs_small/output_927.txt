Taxable Pay4What Payroll Deductions Are Allowed Before Calculating Social Security Tax?As an employer, you are responsible for supplying both your employees and the Internal Revenue Service with a Form W-2 for each employee, showing their taxable income for the year. Knowing how this amount is calculated, as well as the differences between the taxable amounts and gross pay, will allow you to complete accurate W-2s and answer questions your employees may have.Gross PayGross pay represents the total amount paid by a company to its employees. Gross pay does not take into account any pretax deductions or other exemptions from income. For example, if your company pays an employee $4,000 each month, the employee's gross wages for the year equal $48,000. Typically, the gross pay is not found on the Form W-2 because of the various pretax deductions. Instead, the gross pay can be found on the employee's final pay stub for the year.W-2 Wages for Income TaxesIn box 1 of the Form W-2, your company reports the total taxable wages of the employee for IRS record keeping. When you calculate this number, take out any pretax deductions from an employee's pay because they do not count as income for federal income taxes. Examples of pretax deductions include employer-sponsored retirement plan contributions, such as 401 (k) or 403 (b) contributions, flexible spending accounts, dependent care, parking (if tax-exempt) and medical premiums. For example, if you pay an employee $48,000 but she contributes $8,000 to her 403 (b) plan, then you only report $40,000 in box 1.W-2 FICA WagesOn the Form W-2, the Social Security wages in box 3 and the Medicare wages in box 5 are calculated slightly differently from the wages subject to income taxes. The only pretax deductions permitted are dependent care, flexible spending, medical premiums and parking (if tax exempt). The Social Security wages in box 3 are capped by the annual limit for the Social Security tax, which equals $106,800 as of 2011 but adjusts annually for inflation. There is no limit for the Medicare wages in box 5.Significance of the DifferenceThe importance of the difference in the W-2 wages reported and the gross pay is that employees do not get to claim a deduction for the pretax expenses on their income tax return. For example, no tax form contains a line to claim a deduction for 401 (k) or 403 (b) contributions, so if your company fails to properly calculate the W-2 wages from gross pay, the employee could lose the deduction. More likely, however, is that the employee would require you to print a corrected W-2 form.References  (2)Resources  (1)About the AuthorMark Kennan is a writer based in the Kansas City area, specializing in personal finance and business topics.
