"AT&T mvno Airvoice or cricket wirelessby henry001 Â» Sun Sep 14, 2014 8:18 pmHello, I was wondering if anyone has experience moving from AT&T to Airvoice Wireless or Cricket Wireless. If so which one would you recommend. My contract is currently over with AT&T and I am considering moving over to one of the MVNO carriers. AirVoice has a $30 plan which includes: Unlimited Anytime Minutes Unlimited Text Unlimited MMS 500MB Web Cricket Wireless plan is $35 Unlimited Anytime Minutes Unlimited Text Unlimited MMS 1 GB at high-speed I contacted both carriers and they reported that I do not need to unlock my phone with AT&T. All I need to do is get a new sim card and I can port my phone number over. I wanted to know if there are any drawbacks by not unlocking my phone. The phone I have is a Samsung Galaxy S III. It is currently two years old. If I want to sell the phone in the future would it be beneficial to unlock it? What if I go to Cricket and later change to Airvoice....would my phone need to be unlocked moving from carrier to carrier? Also, I if anyone is with Airvoice or Cricket please provide your experience with either carrier as I am looking to switch asap."
