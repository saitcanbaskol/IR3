"1964 World’s FairThe year was 1964, a period in American history where hope for the future still burned bright from the previous decade. Technology and industry were making great strides, especially in the area of space exploration, and the city of New York recognized that the time was ripe for an encore to the 1939 World’s Fair.The planning was placed in the able hands of Robert Moses, a man who had already given the Big Apple so much by way of public parks and bold urban planning that served to better connect the city to the surrounding communities. His vision and determination would make the 1964 World’s Fair perhaps one of the best-remembered in the history of the event.The 1964-1965 New York World's Fair RememberedYour browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available.

First of all, another World’s Fair had been held too recently in the United States, violating their long-standing rules. Second, the fair would need to charge admission and be held over two six-month seasons, both of which were also not allowed. Undeterred, the city went forth anyway, despite the fact that the regulating body would ask many of the major nations not to participate. As a result, the Fair mainly focused on American industry, with only a handful of other nations in attendence.Located on the same grounds where the 1939 World’s Fair were held, in Flushing, NY, the event was billed as the first billion-dollar fair, and attendance expectations were high. But it would take many months before this fair would catch the attention of the masses, which meant pretty disappointing attendance numbers in the first year. The event would eventually go on to make over 50 million dollars, but only thanks to a surge in popularity in its final few weeks.But despite the financial hardships and lack of sanctioning, this was a Fair that left its visitors in awe. The biggest corporations of the day spared no expense in their exhibits, such as the ultra-popular Futurama exhibit, hosted by General Motors. Here, visitors could catch a glimpse of what the future might look like as they traveled in moving chairs through the large exhibit. Bell Systems also utilized similar single-passenger vehicles to transport guests through a series of dioramas that depicted the innovations in the communications realm, including such futuristic devices as speaker phones, touchtone phones, and the most amazing of them all, the video phone.'64-65 NY World's Fair FUTURAMA Ride VideoYour browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available.

He would design “It’s a Small World” for Pepsi – a boat ride familiar to anyone who has ever visited a Disney theme park. He would also introduce a new technology he had been working on called audio-animatronics, allowing both human and beast to move in life-like fashion.He proceeded to put dinosaurs in the Ford exhibit and Mr. Lincoln reciting his Gettysburg Address in a show sponsored by the state of Illinois. Finally, for General Electric, he used his audio-animatronics in a revolving theater to tell the story of electrical innovations past, present and future in the “Carousel of Progress.” Upon the fair’s completion, all of these exhibits would be moved to their new home in Disneyland, where most can still be seen to this day.Disneyland Goes to the New York World's Fair (Part 1)Your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available.

While these confections are now commonplace in just about every restaurant serving breakfast, they supposedly have never tasted a fraction as good as they did at the World’s Fair, at least that’s what the tasters insist.Today, little remains of the World’s Fair. A public park, a few buildings and some ghostly remnants are all that are left. The iconic Unisphere globe still sits in the center, a reminder to the fair’s theme (“Man’s achievement on a shrinking globe in an expanding universe”) and the rusted observation towers loom overhead, over 40 years after they carried their last passengers.But the memories of the 1964 World’s Fair remain strong in the minds of everyone who had an opportunity to visit, to explore, and to dream of what the future might hold. And, as far as what the future holds regarding another New York World’s Fair, there is currently a movement under way to make a bid for the 2020 World’s Fair. With a little luck, perhaps there will finally be a reason to polish up the Unisphere after all these years.Were you one of those youngsters lucky enough to visit this iconic event? Or, perhaps you heard stories passed on from friends or relatives that attended. We would love to hear your recollections of the 1964 World’s Fair in our comments section, as we fondly remember a time in our history when the future seemed so promising, so limitless."
