I upgraded to IOS7 and it was running a bit slow, I tried to update it last night to IOS7.02, so I closed any open apps and then held in the menu button and lock button till the apple logo appeared to clear out any carrier settings, plugged it in and left it to download and install the new update.Came back later and the phone was in restore mode, I thought fine I will just restore from iCloud backup. When I entered my Apple ID it gave me a list of backups so I selected the most recent one. It then said ""enter the Apple ID password for trillzexclusive@gmail.com to use for store purchases (including the App Store, iTunes Store and iBooks Store)This is not my Apple ID, I have never heard of this email address and I have never put it into my phone. My phone is a standard iPhone 4 32GB, it has never been jail broken. All my apps are paid for through iTunes with my Apple ID.I haven't tried my password with this Apple ID, as I don't think it's a good idea, it worries me though, where has it come from?The only thing I thing I can think this might be related to is recently Apple sent me an email saying my complimentary MobileMe 20GB storage was expiring and would be reduced to 5GB. My Apple ID goes right back to the .Mac days so I don't see how it could belong to anyone else.Pic below.Reply 18SubscribePopular Topics in iPhone & iPadAre you smarter than most IT pros?iphone 8 plus apple id lockOutlook and iPhone out of syncemployee trackingTEST YOUR SMARTSWhich of the following retains the information it's storing when the system power is turned off?GPURAMCPUROMSubmit Â» 88% of IT pros got this right.18 RepliesThai Pepperlmaslany Oct 4, 2013 at 4:08 AMFrom where did you buy the phone?Was this post helpful?Spice ReplyTabascoScotty-G Oct 4, 2013 at 4:19 AMIt could be anything.If you bought the phone second hand it could be the previous owner.If you had it replaced under the warranty or by insurance you will usually get a reconditioned unit (again previous owner)If you have charged it in somebody's laptop and it has started to sync it could have pulled it down from itunes.Was this post helpful?Spice ReplyChipotleOPalex howard Oct 4, 2013 at 4:33 AMThe phone was bought new from Vodafone, however I think it may of been replaced on the insurance 2.5 years ago as the screen was smashed.its only ever been sync with my MacBook Pro.How can I restore the iCloud backup onto it?Was this post helpful?Spice ReplyTabascoScotty-G Oct 4, 2013 at 4:47 AMSet it up as a new phone, connect it to your MacBook Pro, then try a manual restore from iTunes.Was this post helpful?Spice ReplyThai Pepperlmaslany Oct 4, 2013 at 4:53 AMQuick note: Be sure you do not enable the iOS 7 Activation Lock feature - if the phone thinks trillzexclusive@gmail.com is the owner you'll lock yourself out of the phone...

Again I am not an IOS Guru, I know a very little, just my .02 cents, so if there is something wrong with my theory there by all means let me know, but just keep in mind I never claimed to be an IOS know-it-all.Was this post helpful?Spice ReplyThai PepperPaul3215 Oct 4, 2013 at 5:52 AMyou can go to the setting and sign out and sign in with a correct apple ID...Settings>Store>tap on your AppleID.

What I did was plug it up to my iTunes as a new iPhone, synced it. Then did Erase All Settings and Content on the phone, put it to restore mode. Then did restore iCloud backup, entered AppleID and then the trillzexclusive@gmail.com ID came up but there was an option to skip this step, I did that, then my ID came up I entered the password. Then another 5 different ID's came up which I was able to skip past.I can assure you I properly wiped the phone when I got it. I also normally do a complete wipe when an IOS version comes out and then setup from scratch to keep it clean, so must of wiped it several times in the past. I have never had to do an iCloud restore until now. It would seem somehow these Apple ID's are associated to the phone with iCloud. As I have never had this problem with a new phone or with my iPads, just this phone which was replaced off my insurance.Thanks for everyones help.Was this post helpful?Spice ReplyPimientoSparky672 Nov 20, 2013 at 12:16 PM 1st PostI had this exact same problem today with a brand new iPhone 5s purchased directly from Verizon. I solved it the same way as described by alex in his last post... skip that step and a new email address loads. When I saw mine, I entered my password... I had to skip four of five other unknown email addresses. It was exactly as alex described... very very strange.Even after the restore was complete and I tried accessing something that required an iTunes login, the same five unknown email addresses came up in the login box. Although in this case, I could delete it and type in my correct login. It still insisted on showing me all five in succession where I had to click cancel button on each.Clearly something is corrupted in Apple's iCloud someplace.EDIT:With a bit of Googling, I've found the root of this issue and it's not a corruption in iCloud.If you've received ""purchased"" items from anyone, even if these items are DRM-free, the original purchaser's Apple ID is stored in the file. Check ""Get Info"" for the file in iTunes. Also see Doug's AppleScripts for a method to see all Apple ID's from all files in your entire iTunes library...http:/ / dougscripts.com/ itunes/ scripts/ ss.php? sp=trackdownpurchasesSo for example, you have some MP3 files you downloaded from a torrent or received from a friend... for this thread, let's assume you own the CD so having an MP3 version is not a legal issue. If those MP3 files are considered ""purchased"" from Apple Store, then you are required to enter the Apple ID credentials for each of these items in order to download a new copy from the Apple Store. That's why it's asking for multiple logins and when you ""skip"" each one, you'll eventually see your own Apple ID. By skipping these ""unknown"" Apple ID's, there does not seem to be a downside, since presumably you still have the originals in your iTunes library. If you were to provide the correct passwords, these items would be downloaded from the Apple Store otherwise.The fix is to find and remove these various ""purchased"" files that contain the unknown Apple IDs. If there is no copyright issue, you could do a ""Create an AAC version"" in iTunes which makes an identical copy minus the ""purchased"" status and Apple ID. If you don't already have these items in your iTunes library, then this is a moot point since you wouldn't have been able to re-download these ""unauthorized"" files from the Apple Store.Edited Nov 22, 2013 at 2:34 PMWas this post helpful?Spice ReplyPimientomustachesbowties Aug 27, 2014 at 4:34 AM 1st PostYea this happened to me a few days ago but with my friends email I just pressed skip and after a day the pop ups with her email went awayWas this post helpful?Spice ReplyPimientocaptaincunnox Aug 31, 2014 at 5:46 AM 1st PostSame thing! just went to restore my iphone 5s from icloud backup and it asked me for an Apple Id that wasn't mine but was a friends ID which seems to confirm what your saying SPARKY672 as he has sent me music files (that he owns on itunes) in the past via email (i've never synced with his apple mac). I tried erasing all content and restoring factoring settings and his ID still comes up. I skipped that step, then it said that i had to supply the password for his ID if i wanted itunes purchases transferred. I skipped anyway and my ID never showed, it just started to restore from icloud. It's still in the process of restoring, will let you know how it goes..........okay it worked! my phone asked me to enter my Apple ID at the final stages of restoring from Icloud which i did then my friends ID came up again and it wanted that password too! So I just erased his ID using the iphone5 keypad and typed my own ID in there then entered my password, which was accepted. Everything looks ok, itunes purchases have transferred as it turns out, all content and settings are there, but what a hassle! Apple need to sort their shit out!Was this post helpful?Spice ReplyPimientogemmaalbone Aug 14, 2015 at 12:38 PM 1st PostPlease help me comes up with se one elses apple id i cant get into the phone ive done all resettings about 4 yimes still comes up with it i have phoned apple and was very rude to me basivly told me they couldnt help please help ive been tryinh for 3 weeks nowWas this post helpful?Spice ReplySonoratariqmajid Aug 26, 2015 at 10:01 AMyea it really could be alot of things did you get through with this i been trying and have the same issueWas this post helpful?Spice ReplySonoratariqmajid Aug 26, 2015 at 10:21 AMthere are some people that can get the icloud removedWas this post helpful?Spice ReplySubscribeThis topic has been locked by an administrator and is no longer open for commenting.To continue this discussion, please ask a new question ."
