"LEE’S SUMMIT, Mo. — Lee’s Summit City Council decided to table the vote Thursday night that would allow a second Walmart Supercenter to be built within the city. The will address the issue again at their first meeting in March. In the interim, they plan to gather more information about how traffic would affect the area around the new Supercenter.If approved, the $25 million development would be built on 24 acres of undeveloped land off 150 Highway and Southwest Market Street in the southern part of Lee’s Summit. It would be just five miles south of the other Lee’s Summit Walmart.If passed, the box store would take about a year to build and would be environmentally friendly. Skylights would save on electricity and other green technology would be implemented to save on energy usage.Besides traffic concerns, some residents believe crime will increase and home property values would fall. Others are concerned Walmart would eventually abandon its other Lee’s Summit store, just as they are doing in Roeland Park, Kan., by moving to Mission, Kan. If abandoned, some wonder what would happen to the store’s building.Currently, Walmart has 20 stores scattered throughout the metro. Besides the possible construction of the store in Lee’s Summit, Walmart is interested in building one in Waldo near 76th and Wyandotte.Filed in: NewsTopics: lee's summit, walmartFacebook Twitter Email"
