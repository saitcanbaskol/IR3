"Topic 3Factors Affecting Plant GrowthWe  will review these factors because of the limiting effects they have on use  of plant nutrients.Definition  of growth - The  progressive development of an organism.Usually  expressed as dry weight (total of the part we're interested in such as  grain), height, length, diameterGrowth  of an annual plant related to time is an S shaped curve for an or one growing season for a perennial plant.growthtimeGrowth  related to the factors affecting it.G = f (X 1, X 2, X 3 ..... Xn)G = measure of growthXi = growth factorsThe  factors that affect plant growth can be classified as genetic or  environmental.A. Genetic Factor1.  Field crops - Yield potential is determined  by genes of the plant. A  large part of the increase in yield over the years has been due to hybrids  and improved varieties. Other characteristics such as quality, disease  resistance, drought hardiness are determined by the genetic makeup. Corn  hybrids are an example of a dramatic yiel incease resulting from genetics. Genetic engineering is now becoming an important tool in changing a plants potential.2.  Nursery crops and turf - not interested in total growth as much as  appearance. Ex. is Bermudagrass1.  Coastal bermudagass - As a forage the grower is  interested in yield and feed quality.2. Tifdwarf - Golf greens - interested in appearance,  cover, wear resistance not how much total growth occurs.3.  Variety and Plant Nutrient needs-Hybrid corn producing 200 bu /ac requires more plant nutrients than a  hybrid producing 100 bu /ac. As potential crop  yields are increased, the plant nutrients required are increased. Current  research in the Soil Science and Genetics department is concerned with  developing corn hybrids that use nitrogen more efficiently - Produce more  grain per pound of N - fertilizer.4. A  producer has control over the genetic factor by his choice of variety.Field crops - highest yielding,  disease resistant, etc.Nursery - Best appearance -  dwarf vs larger shrubsB. Environmental  Factorsdefinition - All external  conditions and influences affecting the life and development of an  organism.The following  are regarded as the most important environmental factors· Temperature· Moisture supply· Radiant energy· Composition of the atmosphere· Soil aeration and soil structure· Soil reaction· Biotic factors· Supply of mineral nutrients· Absence of growth-restricting substancesEach  can be a limiting factor in plant growth. These environmental factors do  not act independently example - inverse relationship between soil moisture  and aira. Temperature - A measure of the intensity of  heat. Plant growth occurs in a fairly narrow range - 60 - 100 degrees F1.  Temperature directly affectsphotosynthesisrespirationtranspiration - loss of waterabsorption  of water and nutrients2. The  rate of these processes increases with an increase in temperature. Responses  are different with different cropscotton vs collards or potatoesfescue vs bermuda grassThis generalization  holds within a crops range of adaptation.3.  Temperature also affects soil organisms. Nitrifying bacteria inhibited by  low temperature. pH may decrease in summer due to activities of  microorganisms.4.  Soil temperature affects water and nutrient uptake.b. Moisture supply - Plant growth restricted by low  and high levels of soil moisture1. can  be regulated with drainage and irrigation2.  good soil moisture improves nutrient uptakeIf  moisture is a limiting factor fertilizer is not used efficiently.c. Radiant energyQuality,  intensity and duration of light are important1. Quality can't be  controlled on a field scale - Feasible on specialty crops2. Intensity of light  (brightness) is an important factor.photosynthesis  light intensityCorn  with upright leaves being bred to intercept more light3. Duration - Photoperiodism - Plant behavior in relation to  day length- long  day plants - flower only if days are longer than same critical period - 12  hours for grains and clovers- short day plants - flower only if days are shorter than  a critical period soybeans.- indeterminate - flower over a wide range of day lengths.  Tomato, cotton, buckwheatSome  crops fail to flower in certain geographical areasChrysanthemums  can be made to bloom by controlling photoperiod.d. Composition of  the atmosphereCO 2 makes up 0.03 per cent of air by volume. Photosynthesis converts CO 2 to organic material in the plant. CO 2 is returned to atmosphere  by respiration and decompositionIn a  corn field or closed greenhouse CO 2 level may drop and become a  limiting factor in growth.Increasing  CO 2 can increase crop yields respiration of plants and animals -  decomposition of manure or plant residue may release CO 2greenhouse  cropsPlant  growth and quality can be enhanced by supplemental CO 2. Growth  responses have been shown with tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, flower crops,  greens, peas, beans, potatoesAir QualityAir  pollutants in sufficient quantities are toxic to plants sulfur dioxide -  provides sulfur at low levelscarbon  monoxidehydrofluoric  acide. Soil aerationCompact  soils of high bulk density and poor structure are aerated poorly.Pore  space is occupied by air and water so the amount of air and water are  inversely proportional to the amount of oxygen in the soil. On well drained  soils, oxygen content is not likely to be limiting to plant growth.Plants  vary widely in their sensitivity to soil oxygen. Paddy rice vs tobaccof. Soil reaction- pH influences availability of certain nutrients ex  phosphate availability low on acid soils. Al is toxic to plantsdiseases  affected by pHPotato  scab controlled by keeping pH below 5.5g. Biotic factorsdisease  - heavier fertilization may increase vegetative growth and susceptibility  to diseaseRoot  knot nematodes reduce absorption so more fertilizer is necessary.insectsweeds  - compete for moisture nutrients lightallelopathy - harmful  substances released by roots.h. Plant NutrientsEssential  Plant Nutrients - Those elements  that are needed for higher plants to complete all life functions, and that  the deficiencycan be  corrected only by the application of the specific element causing the  deficiency.Non-mineral nutrients  (from water  and air)carbon,  hydrogen, oxygenMacronutrientsPrimary nutrientsnitrogen,  phosphorus, potassiumSecondary nutrientscalcium,  magnesium, sulfurMicronutrientscopper,  manganese, zinc, boron, molybdenum, chlorine, iron, nickelMineral Elements beneficial to some plantscobalt,  vanadium, sodium, silicon, seleniumi. Absence of growth - restricting substancesHigh concentrations  of plant nutrientsaluminum, nickel, lead  - associated with sewage disposal, wastes from industry, mines, etc.organic  compounds - phenols, oilBack to the SSC 051 Website"
