This keeps you in a golden groove with love and intimacy, earnings and other financial resources and the women who may help in these areas as well as with divorce and third party situations through to the 30th. Make note that the 24th may be a stand-out day with any of these topics at work, with c0-workers, people you hire, the details, your services, any health concerns, or with the animals.I know that this is a Holiday month but your sign has added emphasis on career, personal goals, reputation, achievements, and dealings with authority types that help you to stand out. Starting on the 9th you may find you can get into more talks and meetings, field offers, sign agreements, make sales, write, interview, or hear from these authority types like the boss, parent, judge, or mentor. It will begin to put you out in front of the pack from the 21st forward as the Winter Solstice shines a light on these matters and kicks off a 30 day cycle that pulls you into the lead position here.Between the 9th and 10th you have heightened activity involving a partner, specialist, client/the clients, an agent, attorney, competitor, or other key relationship. This is going to make you busier than usual and may either introduce some last minute surprise, change, excitement, or shock.The NEW MOON falls on the 11th and is all about travel, education, legal matters, weddings, media, marketing, publishing, religion, or politics for you. New Moon's give you a 2 week window to seed new ideas and projects, launch into new territory or take current interests to the next level, a great time to just do it. It may be important to note that Venus will enter into this terrain on the 30th so from here forward you'll see a woman become important in this matter or the love or income needs start to smooth out or come on board.Christmas Day this year is astrologically powerful as 2 major events are slated for the 25th. First, this is the day of the FULL MOON in Cancer. This brings some big closure, ending, achievement, or celebration to the home or with the family. You may find something big comes through or wraps up with a renovation, move, real estate deal, roommate, parent, or security need as well. Emotions will be charged up since Cancer rules our feelings so expect to really feel this high-point. Secondly, the planet Uranus has been Retrograde in your sign for months. Today it goes Direct and you will feel this as some freeing agent ready to take you out there into new directions or in different ways. This may make you feel like jumping out of your skin or surprising others, it's electrical and will add to the Full Moon climax.New Year's Eve has a strong focus on work, details, organizing, what you do with co-workers, people you hire, health, healthy resolutions, pets, and services you provide. Choose one and go big, with a Moon/Jupiter conjunction here you can enter into 2016 with a bang with any of these topics, Happy New Year!
