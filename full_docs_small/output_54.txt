"Clinical InformationAlbumin is a carbohydrate-free protein, which constitutes 55% to 65% of total plasma protein. It maintains oncotic plasma pressure, is involved in the transport and storage of a wide variety of ligands, and is a source of endogenous amino acids. Albumin binds and solubilizes various compounds, including bilirubin, calcium, long-chain fatty acids, toxic heavy metal ions, and numerous pharmaceuticals.Hypoalbuminemia is caused by several factors: impaired synthesis due either to liver disease (primary) or due to diminished protein intake (secondary), increased catabolism as a result of tissue damage and inflammation, malabsorption of amino acids, and increased renal excretion (eg, nephrotic syndrome).Reference Values> or =12 months: 3.5-5.0 g/dLReference values have not been established for patients who are <12 months of age.For SI unit Reference Values, see https://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/order-tests/si-unit-conversion.html.InterpretationHyperalbuminemia is of little diagnostic significance except in the case of dehydration. When plasma or serum albumin values fall below 2.0 g/dL, edema is usually present.CautionsAlbumin values determined by the bromcresol green method may not be identical to the albumin values determined by electrophoresis.Clinical Reference1.
