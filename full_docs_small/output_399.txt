"Forklift OperatorSimply put, our Forklift Operators are master organizers. They help maintain a smooth and orderly process when moving product into Publix's warehouses.How to ApplyContributionsWarehouse Forklift Operators maneuver powered industrial equipment to move cases and pallets and put them away into their assigned slots in the warehouse. When slots located on the ground floor level are full and cannot store any additional product, the Forklift Operators place product in overhead storage slots. As the ground floor slot is emptied by the Warehouse Selectors, the Forklift Operators replenish it, pulling product down from the overhead compartments. The Operators take care to rotate inventory using the most dated inventory first. Furthermore, the Operators help maintain a clean warehouse and sweep out empty slots. Occasionally, they may fill in for the Warehouse Selectors as business needs demand.Qualifications we look forAt least 18 years oldExperience as a forklift operator, preferredAble to work nights, weekends, holidays, and extended periods of timeAble to obtain certification in pallet truck and forklift operationsAble to lift and carry product weighing 40 to 85 pounds (depending on warehouse)Able to sit or stand for long periods of timeSuccessfully complete a Work Attitude SurveyHow to applyGo to the Publix Jobs Center to begin searching our current openings.
