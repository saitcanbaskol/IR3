"Sports Outdoor Recreation HuntingWhat bow draw weight should I get?I'm a 13 year old girl and I want to get a bow to hunt with. I've done lots of research and decided that I don't want a youth bow because I know I'll want a better one and I want the draw weight strong enough to kill a deer (45 pounds). The thing is, if I do get an adult bow, the draw weight will be... show moreUpdate: oh yeah and I'm pretty sure I want a compound bow.Follow 10 answersAnswersRelevanceRatingNewestOldestBest Answer: Hello, ""ILCM""! You need to hit a sporting goods shop and ""try"" a few bows. You have to decide what feels good for you, and whether you want a compound bow or a recurve bow. Once you decide which style of bow you want, get a bow that meets your state's mimum pull weight, and go from there! Generally, bow manufacturers make the same model of bow with a number of draw weights. I know the Martin Jaguar I have is offered with at least 5 different pull weights, beginning at 30#. My PSE ""Deer Hunter"" has a 55# draw. As an aside, I am disabled. As the result of a severe accident that left me disabled, I have no bicep muscle in my left (off) arm. Lifting a 1 gallon jug of milk to place on the top shelf of the refrigerator can put me to my knees, but I am able to to draw both bows. What you can lift or press should have no bearing on the weight of pull you select for your bow. If you like the idea of a recurve bow, you can find the Martin Jaguar (a take down bow) on Amazon and in Sportsman's Guide selling for about $150. Martin makes a great bow, as does PSE and Browning. Like prom dresses and prom shoes ... only you can decide which is best for you!

You might want to strengthen the arm before investing in a bow that way you will know you ""can"" pull it initially. Most compound bows have adjustable draw weights so you could go low initially and increase as you get stronger. I personally would not hunt with anything lower than 40# because I do not want to make a pin cushion of an animal but want a clean deep penetration or better yet a pass through shot. The size and toughness of the animal will dictate draw weight, arrow weight, broad head weight. It is a little different hunting a dear than a bear calling for slightly different tactics and equipment. I actually own two compounds with different ""adjustable"" draw wights and lengths. I also have ""stick"" bows that have set draw weights at 28"" of draw. Good luck!

Here in BC Canada, a 40 pound draw weight is the minimum for bow hunting deer. I have both a 40 pound and a 50 pound take-down longbow. I like those because I'm not into all the bells and whistles. I don't use sights or counter weights or anything like that - I just shoot 'instinctive'. I did take a course and I do practice so I'm pretty good. (I'm not all that good and I'm not trying to brag but you gotta practice a little more than with fancy bows) I like the 'take down' feature (the limbs detach so that you can store and carry it more easily - they fit easily into a backpack for example without anything protruding so you can hike through the bush). The downside is that a longbow requires a bit more strength to hold while you're aiming. I'm a big strong adult male so it's no problem for me but it might be an issue for you (might not too - test it out). A compound bow's tension eases off at the length of your draw so you don't have to 'hold' the energy, making it much easier to aim. Most people prefer that but I don't like the added complexity. I like a simple recurve longbow. Like I said, there is a lot of personal preference. Maybe go to your local archery store or target range and try some out.megalomaniac · 6 years ago0 0 1 commentBow WeightSource (s):https://shrinke.im/a8YTBreneau · 1 year ago0 0 CommentYou will need to make use of months or even years on working out the pulling techniques.

Get an adjustible that starts at 45# draw. You will also need to find one that matches your draw length. At 13 it's likely to be short, so buy one that starts at your present draw and can be 'let out' as you grow into it.

Learn a 'press-draw' where you push out with your bow hand while you draw up with the string hand.

I don't think it matters how much you can bench cause pulling back a bow is alot different and you use different muscles in different ways. Get a youth bow and at first it doesn't have to be at 45 pounds until you hunt with it. When you practice with it, you will move the pounds up fast. Maybe in a month you can have it at 45 poundsSource (s):It's been a couple years now and I'm at 70 poundserik · 6 years ago0 1 CommentLook for a used Parker Buckshot in the 45lb model. I believe it is adjustable up to 50lbs. Should be able to find a decent used one in the 200 dollar area. Adjustable draw length too. Great starter bow.Source (s):Bowhunted for over 10 years.texastweeter · 6 years ago0 0 CommentYou can go to your local archery or sporting goods store and see if they will let you test bows, that is a good way to find out how much you can draw and what will work for you.Jake · 6 years ago0 0 CommentMaybe you would like to learn more about one of these?Need a Small Business Loan?
