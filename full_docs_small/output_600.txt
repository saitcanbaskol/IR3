"American Journal of Clinical PathologyIsolated Ileal Erosions in Patients With Mildly Altered Bowel HabitsA Follow-up Study of 28 PatientsNeal S. Goldstein, MDDisclosuresAm J Clin Pathol. 2006;125 (6):838-846.In This ArticleAbstract and IntroductionMaterials and MethodsResultsDiscussionReferencesResultsControl Normal Ileal Mucosal FeaturesLymphoid aggregates were present in 16 sections (16%) Table 1 . Of the sections, 13 had 1 lymphoid aggregate, 2 sections had 2 lymphoid aggregates, and 1 section had 3 aggregates. Of the 100 sections, 11 (11%) had foci of active inflammation involving 1 or 2 adjacent crypt bases. Of these 11 sections, 5 had 1 focus of active inflammation, 5 had 2 foci, and 1 had 3 foci. None of the active inflammation foci were associated with villous architectural distortion, lamina propria edema, erosions, or hemorrhages.Clinical and Endoscopic FindingsOf the 28 study patients, 25 (89%) were female. The mean and median patient ages at sentinel colonoscopy were 32.3 and 28 years, respectively (range, 17-46 years). All 28 patients had complaints of looser than normal stools and an increased defecation rate (mean, 2.9 stools per day; range, 2-5 stools per day). Fifteen patients also complained of occasional postprandial bloating and increased flatulence. None of the patients had abdominal pain, sharp cramps, constipation, bloody or mucus-rich stools, systemic or upper gastrointestinal symptoms, perianal abscesses, or fistulas. Celiac disease-related serum antibody titers were within the normal range in all 28 patients. Four patients were ingesting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at the time of the sentinel colonoscopy, either daily or as multiple doses per week. Information regarding the duration of NSAID ingestion before the sentinel endoscopy for these 4 patients was not available. Stool cultures and smears for ova and parasites were negative in all patients.The colonic mucosa was endoscopically normal in all cases. In the terminal ileum, each case had one to several discrete, focal erosions within otherwise normal small bowel mucosa. The erosions were located 1 to 3 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve haustral contraction ring. None were located marginally or on a prominent mucosal fold. The ileal mucosa around and proximal to the ulcers was uniformly normal. No mucosal erythema or targetoid rings were present around the erosions. The aphthoid ulcers and the mucosa surrounding them were not raised or volcano-like projections. Each erosion was approximately 1 mm in dimension. One erosion was found in 10 cases (36%), and 18 cases (64%) had several closely clustered erosions.Pathologic FindingsNo erosion was seen histologically in the initial 3 slides cut from each block in 19 cases (68%). Serial sections completely through the tissue block were obtained in these 19 cases, which revealed a single focal erosion in 12 cases. No erosions were identified histologically in 7 cases (25%), despite the complete serial sectioning and targeted biopsies. In these 7 cases, there was one endoscopic erosion in 5 cases and several endoscopic erosions in 2 cases. The ileal lesion tissue fragments in these 7 cases were morphologically similar Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4. Villi were architecturally normal or slightly irregular in size and shape. There was slight expansion of the lamina propria by patchy edema and a focal lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. Crypts within edematous regions were disarrayed slightly, with an irregular distribution and slight variation in size owing to the edema and lymphoid aggregate. All 7 lesions had sparse to mild active inflammation involving several crypts. A moderate number of eosinophils were present in the lamina propria; however, eosinophils did not infiltrate crypts and no eosinophilic microabscesses were seen. The density of goblet cells was not increased appreciably. (Enlarge Image)Figure 1.Endoscopic ileal ulcer tissue fragment in which no histologic erosion was identified. Crohn disease did not develop during follow-up. The lamina propria is expanded by patchy edema and focal lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. There are slight villous and crypt architectural irregularities (H&E, ×24). (Enlarge Image)Figure 2.Higher magnification of Figure 1. Crypts are distributed irregularly and vary in size owing to the edema and mildly lymphoplasmacytic inflammation (H&E, ×120). (Enlarge Image)Figure 3.Higher magnification of Figure 1. A focus of mild active inflammation partially involves a crypt (H&E, ×160). (Enlarge Image)Figure 4.Endoscopic ileal ulcer tissue fragment in which no histologic erosion was identified. Typical Crohn disease symptoms developed 4.5 years after this biopsy was performed. A, A single focus of abnormal inflammation is located in the center of the tissue fragment. Villous architecture is normal, and the lamina propria contains a normal density of inflammatory cells (H&E, ×48). B, Sparse, active inflammation infiltrates 2 adjacent crypts within the center of the inflammatory focus (H&E, ×320).The morphologic features of the 21 lesions in which an erosion was identified histologically also were similar Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, and Figure 8. Active inflammation and fibrin overlaid a small region in which the surface epithelium was absent. Adjacent, intact surface epithelium had regenerative cytologic changes. The subjacent lamina propria was expanded by focal edema, active inflammation, and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. Crypt architectural disarray was present owing to the inflammation and edema. Similar to the cases in which no erosion was identified morphologically, the density of lamina propria eosinophils was moderate and goblet cells did not appear to be increased. None of the biopsy specimens had mucous (pyloric) gland metaplasia. (Enlarge Image)Figure 5.Endoscopic ileal ulcer tissue fragment in which histologic erosion was identified. This patient was ingesting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on a daily basis at the time of the biopsy. NSAIDs were discontinued, and follow-up endoscopy showed normal ileum. The right half of the tissue fragment is relatively normal. There is patchy edema and inflammation involving the left half of the tissue fragment. A small erosion is present in the distal end of the fragment (H&E, ×48). (Enlarge Image)Figure 6.Higher magnification of Figure 5. A, Mucosal erosion. There is moderate crypt disarray, edema, and mixed inflammation immediately subjacent to the erosion (H&E, ×120). B, Deeper level of erosion. The surface epithelium adjacent to the erosion shows regenerative changes. Active inflammation infiltrates this epithelium and forms a small crypt abscess within the center of erosion (H&E, ×160). (Enlarge Image)Figure 7.Endoscopic ileal ulcer tissue fragment in which histologic erosion was identified. Typical Crohn disease symptoms developed 6.4 years after this biopsy was performed. Despite the tangential sectioning, villus architecture appears to be within the normal range. There is patchy, abnormal lamina propria edema. Crypts are irregularly distributed throughout the lamina propria and vary in diameter owing to the patchy edema. The density of lymphoplasmacytic inflammation in the lamina propria is within normal limits, and the 2 lymphoid follicles are prominent but also within normal limits (H&E, ×24). (Enlarge Image)Figure 8.Higher magnification of Figure 7. A, There is a small erosion of the mucosa between the lymphoid follicles (H&E, ×120). B, The surface epithelium has regenerative changes, and there is active inflammation in the superficial lamina propria and the surface epithelium adjacent to the erosion (H&E, ×320).The ileal mucosa around and distant from the focal erosions was normal in all 28 cases Figure 9.

Villi are architecturally normal, and the lamina propria is devoid of patchy edema or focal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates (H&E, ×120).Clinical Course and OutcomeIn 26 patients, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans within 3 weeks of the sentinel colonoscopy appeared normal. The altered bowel habits resolved with a several-week course of loperamide or diphenoxylate in all 28 patients. NSAIDs were discontinued immediately in the 4 patients who were taking them. All 28 patients remained minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic during the follow-up period.Typical Crohn disease developed in 8 (29%) of 28 patients after a prolonged interval Table 2 . A single isolated ileal erosion was present endoscopically at the sentinel colonoscopy in 5 of these 8 patients. Of the 8 patients, 6 underwent another colonoscopy 0.9 to 1.7 months after the sentinel colonoscopy. The small bowel and colonic mucosa were endoscopically normal in all 6 patients, and biopsy specimens from the region of the sentinel endoscopic erosions and random areas of the colon all were histologically normal.The mean minimal or asymptomatic interval between the sentinel colonoscopy and typical Crohn disease symptoms was 3.6 years (range, 1.5-6.4 years). All 8 patients with Crohn disease had abdominal pain; mucus-rich, blood-tinged stools; irregular bowel function of intermittent constipation and diarrhea; and low-level systemic malaise. A definitive diagnosis of Crohn disease was made within 5 weeks after reexamination in the 8 patients. Colonoscopy performed after reexamination showed ileal disease in all 8 patients. Biopsy specimens from the involved region showed chronic Crohn ileitis with patchy activity Figure 10 in all 8 patients. In 5 cases, there also was cecal involvement, 2 of which also had patchy, mildly active chronic Crohn colitis in endoscopically normal, random biopsy specimens from more distal colon and rectum. In all 8 patients, an abdominal computed tomography scan was performed as part of the reexamination. A short segment of ileal wall thickening, consistent with early stricture, was present in 3 patients. (Enlarge Image)Figure 10.Ileal biopsy specimens obtained 5.2 years after the initial colonoscopy from a patient in whom Crohn disease symptoms developed. A, There is marked crypt disarray and branching. Villi are fused and blunted. There is large erosion. The lamina propria is distended by inflammatory cells and edema (H&E, ×48). B, Mucous gland or so-called antral gland metaplasia is present subjacent to recently reepithelialized surface (H&E, ×120).According to the Vienna Crohn disease classification system, 3 patients had stricturing-type Crohn disease and 5 had nonstricturing, nonpenetrating (inflammatory)-type Crohn disease.  [ 6] The disease in 1 of the latter 5 patients converted to stricturing-type disease during the subsequent 4 years, and the disease in 1 patient who had ileocecal disease at reexamination evolved into the penetrating-pattern of Crohn disease during 2 years.In 20 patients, including the 4 who were ingesting NSAIDs, inflammatory bowel disease did not develop during the mean follow-up period of 6.6 years (range, 3.4-9.2 years). Of these patients, 17 underwent a follow-up colonoscopy after a mean interval of 2.8 years (range, 0.5-6.3 years). The ileum was devoid of erosions, and the colon was uniformly normal in all 17 patients. Biopsy specimens obtained from the ileum in the region of the sentinel erosions and random areas of the colon were uniformly normal.Next SectionAm J Clin Pathol. 2006;125 (6):838-846. © 2006 American Society for Clinical PathologyAbstract and IntroductionMaterials and MethodsResultsDiscussionReferences"
