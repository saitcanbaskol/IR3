For this reason, people living in high-risk areas should be knowledgeable about Lyme disease.What Causes Lyme Disease?Lyme disease is caused by bacteria transmitted through the bite of the tiny black-legged, or deer, tick found in the Eastern and Central U.S., and the western black-legged tick in the Pacific West. The riskiest months for Lyme disease are May through September, when young ticks are likely to be biting.In humans, the bacteria may cause flu -like symptoms. If left untreated, it may attack many tissues -- including the heart and nervous system -- and trigger an immune response that can lead to Lyme arthritis.WebMD Medical Reference Reviewed by Melinda Ratini, DO, MS on July 25, 2016SourcesÂ© 2016 WebMD, LLC.
