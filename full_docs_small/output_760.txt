"Predatory violence is different from general offending due to certain various traits  associated with predatory/serial offending. Researchers report that offending is influenced by  environmental, cultural, and social factors. According to Siegel & Victoroff (2009), recent  research, however, has showed that aggression has neurological bases and is characterized by  two differing forms: affective aggression (or defensive aggression) and predatory aggression (or  premeditated aggression). Unlike affective aggression, predatory aggression requires the use of  the frontal cortex, which is responsible for planning. The limbic system is also responsible for  regulating aggression and rage. Siegel & Victoroff (2009) establish a link between human  predatory aggression and aggression in cats due to their similar pattern.   Low self-control is a strong predictor of life-course criminality according to DeLisi   (2013). Predatory offenders tend to have low self-control. Research by DeLisi on juvenile  arrestees and aggression concluded that low self-control likely resulted in aggressive behavior  toward others. Research also points to the link between low self-control early in life and its  stability across time. Similarly, meta-analyses on consciousness and health-related behaviors  concluded that individuals with low self-control tend to be less conscientious. Aggressive  individuals also present reduced frontal functioning.   Research also points to the link between childhood traumatization and antisocial and  aggressive behavior; Krischer & Sevecke (2008) posit that early traumatization leads to  aggression and violence due to its negative effect on anger and rage regulation. A study by Lang,  Klinteberg & Alm (2002) on the connection between childhood abuse and neglect and violent  behavior revealed that children who had been neglected and abused were more likely to score  higher on the Psychopathy Checklist – Revised (PCL-R). While the results somewhat differed  among female and male victimization (traumatization affects females less severely), research findings revealed that persistent youth offenders experienced environmental and biological  stressors.   According to DeLisi (2009), psychopathy is antisocial behavior in its worst form.  Persistent offenders tend to be psychopaths. Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized  by certain emotional/interpersonal and social deviance symptoms. According to Hare (1999),  emotional symptoms include superficiality, egocentricity, lack of remorse or guilt, callousness,  deceitfulness and manipulation, and shallow emotions. Social deviance symptoms include  impulsivity, poor behavior controls, need for excitement and lack of responsibility, early  behavior problems, and adult antisocial behavior. DeLisi (2013) explains that research studies on  Canadian offenders determined a link between psychopathy, recidivism, and persistent  offending. In fact, a study by Laurell & Vaughn (2008) concluded that many murderers scored  above the threshold of 30, which is considered the cut-off measuring score for psychopathy   (scores less than 20 are considered non-psychopathy level). Laurell & Däderman (2007) studied  psychopathy levels in homicide offenders and found that 40% of participants were classified as  psychopaths.   Current literature identifies psychopathy as the personality disorder that afflicts many  persistent offenders whereby they lack cognitive, emotional, and societal functions leading them  to a path of life-persistent maladaptive behavior. Research results support the conclusion that a  great number of individuals who have committed violent crimes are psychopaths.  References  DeLisi, M. (2009).
