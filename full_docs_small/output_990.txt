What's the problem? I guess people don't want to accept this phase of John Lennon's career, when for better or for worse he was actively involved in radical left-wing politics. Gone is the syrupy gloss that sugar-coated ""Imagine."" In its place is raw, unfiltered, immediate and uncompromising political rock and roll. Is it dated? Sure, just like a newspaper from the era would be. (The packaging wasn't a mistake -- this was music for the times.) But is it valuable and listenable? Yes. People moan about Yoko's tunes and singing, but her stuff here is quite powerful. Fact is, some folks can't handle it. That's fine, but not an acceptable excuse for dismissing it. This is a necessary listen for anyone who wants to truly understand John Lennon and Yoko Ono as human beings and as an artists. Read moreComment 4 people found this helpful.

Yes No Report abusePaul Haspel4.0 out of 5 stars Some time hearing John Lennon get unproductively angryJune 13, 2013Format: Audio CD Verified PurchaseSome time ago, in 1972, John Lennon released his third solo album. Titled ""Some Time in New York City,"" it represented a departure in some ways from John's prior solo work. As opposed to the raw, no-holds-barred, deeply personal quality of 1970's ""John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band,"" or the lyrical emotionalism that Lennon achieved on 1971's ""Imagine,"" ""Some Time"" seeks direct engagement with the tendentious political landscape of the time in which the album was released (an intent reinforced by the album's newspaper-style cover design). Another key difference between ""Some Time"" on the one hand and ""Plastic Ono Band"" or ""Imagine"" on the other is that Yoko Ono has a more overt songwriting and singing presence than had been the case on the two earlier albums. None of these factors can be said to have been particularly conducive to the success of ""Some Time in New York City."" Where this album does succeed, it succeeds almost in spite of itself. Those paradoxical and contradictory qualities of the album are apparent from the first line of the first track, ""Woman Is the N----r of the World."" Really, John? Was it truly necessary to take the most poisonous racial slur in existence, and to make it the centerpiece of the album's would-be hit single? I know, I know -- John and Yoko really wanted to dramatize the cruelty of sexism and gender bias throughout the world, and the use of the racial slur is meant to have an in-your-face quality, so that one can't ignore or minimize the social ills discussed by the song. But I stand with those who would say that no white person, not even John Lennon, can use that word without opening up a whole new set of problems unrelated to whatever problems said white person is trying to address. It also doesn't help that there is a disconnect between the song's serious subject matter and its jaunty delivery, with a jazzy saxophone solo reinforcing the song's bouncy tempo. Some nice minor-key work here, but I can't help thinking that the song is in large measure a mistake. The same could be said of the following track, ""Sisters, O Sisters."" Let me say at the outset that I grow tired of the Yoko-bashing that is so often a feature of the critical response to John Lennon's work. I do not blame Yoko Ono for the breakup of the Beatles (notwithstanding the ""I Still Blame Yoko"" bumper stickers that one sees on the backs of cars from time to time), and I feel strongly that John and Yoko's relationship was their business and no one else's. That being said, I am obligated to say in candor that Yoko Ono's vocal efforts, on this album, are largely unsuccessful. On too many of the songs on this album, Yoko does not sing so much as she shouts -- sometimes on key, sometimes not. In the case of ""Sisters, O Sisters,"" the song's potentially interesting 1950's organ sound and pro-revolution lyrics are undone by the manner in which Yoko sings the song. ""Attica State,"" reflecting as it does the tensions surrounding the notorious prison riot of September 1971, is discordant in style and tone, but is no doubt meant to be; its thematic suggestion -- that the conditions at the Attica prison represent the confining qualities of American society generally -- could perhaps have been developed in greater detail. ""Born in a Prison,"" one of a number of examples on this album of John and Yoko taking different approaches to the same subject matter, is one of Yoko's better songs, but again is undone by Yoko's limited singing proficiency. In spite of some nice strings, and an appropriate quality of simplicity, the song's attempts at achieving a wistful quality are unsuccessful; and when Yoko shouts, ""Born in a Prison!"" it's an embarrassment. But then the album takes a decided turn for the better, as John delivers the great, energetic, bluesy ""New York City"" -- the one song from this album that people still play. John's well-known love for N.Y.C. really comes through here; guitar, saxophone, and Jerry Lee Lewis-style piano work together flawlessly, and the song's numerous and specific New York references put you right there. Que pasa, New York? The album's next two songs both deal with one of the many tragic political events of the turbulent 1970's -- the ""Bloody Sunday"" killings of January 1972, when 13 unarmed demonstrators in Derry/Londonderry, Northern Ireland, were shot dead by British Army paratroopers. The military-style drumming and strident saxophone set a suitably grim tone, but the song's lyrics, with lines like ""It's those mothers' turn to burn"", are just too damn angry. Is this the same guy who, just one year earlier, was asking that we ""Imagine all the people/Living life in peace""? The name-calling does no good; nor does Yoko's off-key shouting. And the song's closing fade-out/fade-in (cf. ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" or ""Helter Skelter"") simply reminds us of times when John had his emotions a bit more under control. Northern Ireland is still the subject of interest in the following song, ""The Luck of the Irish""; the song's melancholy tin-whistle is good and suitable, and John's part of the song is good and nicely autobiographical, with its references to John growing up in Liverpool while hearing about the Irish point of view on British history; but Yoko's part of the song sounds as though it comes straight out of a commercial for that green soap. I also don't like the way both of these songs oversimplify the complexities of the Northern Ireland conflict; there is plenty of blame to go around, on all sides, for the over 3500 deaths that occurred during the Troubles. But nuance is clearly not what John and Yoko are going for here. ""John Sinclair"" also puts one back in the 1970's. I had to go to Wikipedia to learn his story. For a poet to receive a sentence of ten years' imprisonment for giving two marijuana joints to an undercover cop (hence the song's line ""They gave him ten for two"") does seem a bit extreme. I like the song's use of slide guitar, and its energy. And it's good to know that that ten-year sentence for Sinclair (who is still an actively publishing poet) was overturned by the Michigan Supreme Court. Who knows? Perhaps Lennon's activism had some influence there. The song ""Angela"" likewise sent me to Wikipedia, where I learned that Angela Davis, then a controversial political activist who had been arrested by the FBI on charges of kidnapping and murder, and whose activism is supported by the song, recently retired from a faculty position at the University of California Santa Cruz. How times change. ""We're All Water"" is peppy and upbeat, but I wish that someone at the time could have been so good as to inform Ms. Ono that screaming and yelling are no substitute for singing. ""Cold Turkey"" is grim and powerful; its muted melodic line captures well the manner in which a battle against addiction can combine long periods of monotony with unexpected moments of absolute terror. As for ""Don't Worry Kyoko,"" I appreciated the Led Zeppelin-esque guitar riff (strongly reminiscent of ""Good Times Bad Times""), but it goes on forever, and Yoko's persistent screeching of ""Don't worry"" does not help matters. ""Well Baby Please Don't Go"" (""A minor, without standard blues changes"") is very fine -- coolly solid, with fine guitar work. This CD release of ""Some Time in New York City"" contains both sides of a Christmastime single. Yoko's ""Listen the Snow Is Falling"" is nice and gentle, with soft organ, and Yoko actually sings well on this song. John's ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"" is, of course, a classic; and its plea for peace, in the context of a holiday that honors the Prince of Peace, is timeless. Just how many new wars have started in the 30 years since John and Yoko sang ""War is over/If you want it""? Sad to wonder about. In short, ""Some Time in New York City"" is decidedly a mixed bag. Fans of John Lennon's solo work will probably want it, if only as a way of completing their collection of John's post-Beatles oeuvre. More casual fans may lose patience with the album after a while. But it certainly is a bracing plunge into the political turmoil of the early 1970's. Read moreComment 5 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Report abuseAparato SuperSónico4.0 out of 5 stars IF I WERE A JUDGE I'D ADD 40 YEARS TO PHIL SPECTOR'S SENTENCE FOR THE MURDER OF THIS ALBUMJanuary 4, 2013Format: Audio CD Verified PurchasePeople will criticize John Lennon's involvement in political causes around that time in his life. England must have been a pretty terrible place to live in those years. Like an immigrant yearning for freedom, he arrived in New York City - a gritty and decaying city in the early 1970s - and through his protest songs and his newfound friends - made an enemy of one Richard Milhouse Nixon. I heard t his album many years ago, and owned the remastered/remixed CD, but recently purchased the double vinyl with some extra points I had in my credit card - just in case the album sucked... it did not. The album can be shelved as a testament of the chaos of those years - you may not agree with Lennon or Ono's opinions, but at least these two, clumsy as they were, actually got off their butts and tried to do something about it, instead of putting out albums full of BS like his three former band mates. Paul, always the moneymaker; did whatever it took to continue making music and bringing in the bacon. George had a chestful of songs that he released throughout the 1970s and 1980s with mixed results - I would say about 60% of what he put out should have either never seen the light of day or taken back to the shop for some much needed overhaul and improvement before being recorded and released. Ringo released only one good album in his life"" Ringo (1973) and everything he made before and since has been (I'll be kind with Peace and Love here:) at best, disposable. I like all he songs in this album, including Yoko's - she only screams in the last song in the album, but it fits in nicely, unlike the rest of her work. The only thing I really hate about this album is the horrible and ridiculous Wall Of Sound mix by that gun toting loose cannon, mentally unstable, and now, convicted murderer Phil Spector. That little man should have NEVER been allowed anywhere near this album, or any of John's works, or George's ""All Things Must Pass"" - a masterpiece if not for the dated and terrible sound. Hate to say it, but Ringo's albums sound BETTER - despite his singing - than this one and George's. Imagine, Isn't it a pity? Read moreComment 5 people found this helpful.
