"Swimming Pool > Swimming Pool and Spa Chemicals > How To Raise The pH Level In Your PoolHow To Raise The pH Level In Your Swimming PoolRaising The pH Level to 7.4 - 7.8 Using Sodium Carbonate (soda ash)TweetThe proper range for a swimming pool is a pH of 7.4 to 7.8. If your water tests low for pH, then first make sure that your reagents or test strips / kit is working properly. They should be replace yearly as over time they do not work accurately. To raise the ph Level add sodium carbonate, Na2CO3, commonly known as Soda Ash. Use the table below to get a good idea of how much to use based on the water volume of your pool. Use our water volume calculator to know how much water is in your pool.Pool Water pHGallons of Water in the Pool~10,000~15,000~20,000~25,000~30,000~35,000~40,000~45,000~50,0006.61.5 lbs 2.25 lbs 3.0 lbs 3.75 lbs 4.5 lbs 5.25 lbs 6.0 lbs 6.75 lbs 7.5 lbs6.81.25 lbs 1.75 lbs 2.5 lbs 3.0 lbs 3.5 lbs 4.25 lbs 5.0 lbs 5.5 lbs 6.0 lbs7.01.0 lbs 1.5 lbs 2.0 lbs 2.25 lbs 2.75 lbs 3.25 lbs 3.75 lbs 4.25 lbs 4.75 lbs7.2.75 lbs 1.0 lbs 1.25 lbs 1.75 lbs 2.0 lbs 2.25 lbs 2.75 lbs 3.0 lbs 3.25 lbsHOW TO ADD: Add soda ash to a large amount of water (5 gallon bucket), stir to dissolve, and pour slowly around the pool. Retest after one hour.WARNING: Always add chemical to water. Never add water to chemical. Do not mix with any other chemicals. Do not add more than one pound per 10,000 gallons at a time because soda ash is very concentrated and can cloud the pool water. All additions of chemicals are approximate and depend on local conditions.Last Updated: 02/09/2018 06:18 PM - ID:1708"
