Characters Face New ChallengesPosted by Staff Reporter  ( media@realtytoday.com) on Jun 22, 2015 06:10 AM EDTemail print 0 Commentsmore bigLONDON, ENGLAND - JUNE 02: Kerry Washington attends the Glamour Women Of The Year Awards at Berkeley Square Gardens on June 2, 2015 in London, England. (Photo : Anthony Harvey/Getty Images)""Scandal"" Season 5 is set to premiere this coming September and as early as now, fans are already curious as to what will happen to Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) and President Fitzgerald Grant (Tony Goldwyn).In Season 4's finale episode, Olivia and Fitz reunited at the White House after the latter asked his wife, Mellie (Bellamy Young), to leave the place. On the other hand, Jake Ballard (Scott Foley) also gave Olivia his consent and told her that she can now be with the man she truly loves.However, in true ""Scandal"" fashion, Olivia and Fitz may reunite, but this does not mean they will not be faced with major challenges. Many times in the past, the two tried to stay together but they always had other priorities they needed to address first. According to Breathe Cast, the new challenges that the other characters will face in Season 5 will also impact Olivia and Fitz's relationship.For instance, there are reports that Huck (Guillermo Diaz) can team up with Olivia's father and mortal enemy Rowan Pope (Joe Morton). If this were to really happen, Olivia will have no choice but to cut her ties from Huck.Additionally, Lizzie North's (Portia de Rossi) new task as the President's Chief of Staff may cause problems for Fitz. Obviously, Lizzie's intentions to reveal Mellie's partnership with Rowan (Joe Morton) were not done with a clean conscience.In other news, the future seems unclear for Cyrus Beene (Jeff Perry), who was once considered as Fitz's most loyal alliance. After he turned his back on Olivia and the President of the United States, he was removed from his position as chief of staff, Gospel Herald reported.Now so many things can happen in the upcoming Season 5 of ""Scandal"" and there's a chance that Olivia and Fitz would have to go through so much first before they can finally end up together. The show's premiere date is set on September 24.TAG: scandal, Season 5, Spoilers, Olivia Pope, President Fitzgerald Grant, premiere date, castGet the Most Popular RealtyToday Stories in a Weekly NewsletterÂ© 2017 Realty Today All rights reserved.
