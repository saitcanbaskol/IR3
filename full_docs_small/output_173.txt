"What is Tomotherapy?Published December 9, 2010 | By Dr Mehta | 1 CommentDownload PDF of this pageTomotherapy is a relatively new platform for the delivery of radiation therapy. The radiation is produced and delivered by a linear accelerator. This linear accelerator has been integrated into a CT scanner, a configuration that produces several potential advantages.First, the patient can undergo a CT scan just prior to the delivery of radiotherapy. The CT scan obtained prior to the delivery of radiation is used to ensure that the internal targets or tissues that one is seeking to avoid have not changed their location between treatments. This is also called IGRT, or Image-Guided Radiotherapy. IGRT very cleary improves the accuracy and precision of the radiotherapy that is delivered. The potential benefits of this improvement are that less normal and healthy tissue will be exposed to radiation. While this is intuitively a very good thing, it has not been conclusively demonstrated (yet) to be of clinical benefit to each and every patient. Another advantage is that multiple remote areas can be targeted simultaneously. For some patients, this approach might be particularly useful. Finally, the treatment is delivered from a large number of angles (or helical arcs from a simplistic viewpoint), which allows for more honed deliver of radiation.Some of the unique advantages of this platform have been challenged recently. A technique called VMAT, or Volumetric Arc Therapy (produced by Elekta) and Rapid Arc (produced by Varian) are rival approaches. The radiation is also delivered in one or more “Arcs” of treatment. The linear accelerator comes equipped with IGRT equipment that allows for obtaining a near CT -quality image just prior to treatment.There have been a number of comparison studies between these newer approaches and Tomotherapy. While there might be some very unique cases that are better situated to Tomotherapy, most cases of lung cancer can be treated equally well on both platforms. We have published a comparison study as well, which suggests much the same thing. While the software and hardware for Tomotherapy have improved considerably in the last few years, the delivery time using either VMAT or Rapid Arc is considerably shorter than Tomotherapy. This shorter delivery time has theorectical and practical (you are off the treatment table faster) advantages.I consider myself very lucky to practice in an institution that tries to offer all technologies. We were among the first in the country with IGRT, VMAT, Cyberknife, Gamma Knife, and most recently, Tomotherapy. I strongly believe that patients are best treated by physicians that are experienced in all platforms and can offer patients the best possible treatment plan regardless of platform. Unfortunately, the optimum solution and treatment for a given patient is going to be unique for them.Related Posts:An Introduction to Image-Guided Radiation Therapy May 28, 2008Radiation Therapy and 4-Dimensional (4D) Planning May 21, 2008Radiotherapy for Medically Unresectable NSCLC May 22, 2008Repeating Chest Radiation Therapy: Feasible or… July 14, 2011Whole Brain Radiation Therapy July 30, 2008Posted in Radiation Oncology"
