Oxygen (O), Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Nitrogen (N).Trace elements an element indispensable for life but required in extremely minute amountsWhat is an example of a trace element? iron (Fe)Explain how table salt has emergent properties. ...Is a trace element a essential element? Explain ...In humans, iron is a trace element required for the proper functioning of hemoglobin, the molecule that carries oxygen in red blood cells. What might be the effects of an iron deficiency? ...Explain how natural selection might have played a role in the evolution of species that are tolerant of serpentine soils. ...Atom the smallest unit of matter that retrains the properties of an elementHow do scientist symbolize atoms? with the same symbol that is made up of those atoms.Subatomic Particles What atoms are made of. Using high energy collisions physicists have produced more than a hundred types of particles from the atom.Neutron A subatomic particle having no electrical charge (electrically neutral), with a mass of about 1.7 * 10^-24g, found in the nucleus of an atom.Proton A subatomic particle with a single positive electrical charge, with a mass of about 1.7 * 10^-24 g, found in the nucleus of an atom.Electron A subatomic particle with a single negative electrical charge and a mass about 1/2000 that of a neutron or proton. One or more electrons move around the nucleus of an atom. Because they are so small we ignore electrons when computing the total mass.atomic nucleus an atom's dense central, containing protons and neutronsDalton A measure of mass for atoms and subatomic particles; the same as the atomic mass unit or amu. Neutrons and protons have masses of about 1 dalton.Atomic Number the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom, unique for each element and designated by a subscript. Also a number of electrons in a neutral atomMass Number The sum of the number of protons and neutrons in an atoms nucleus.Atomic Mass the total mass of an atom, numerically equivalent to the mass in grams of 1 mole of the atom. (For element with more than one isotope, the atomic mass is the average mass of the naturally occurring isotopes, weighted by their abundance.)Isotope one of the several atomic forms of the element, each with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons, thus differing in atomic mass.decay when an atoms nuclei do have a tendency to lose subatomic particles.radioactive isotope an isotope (an atomic form of a chemical element) that is unstable; the nucleus decays spontaneously, giving off detectable particles and energy. When this leads to a change in the number of protons it transforms the atom to an atom of a different element.How do we use radioactive isotopes in the field of medicine? diagnostic tools. Cells use the radioactive atoms just as they would use nonradioactive isotopes of the same element. These isotopes are incorporated into biologically active molecules, which are uses as tracers to tract the atoms during metabolism.half-life the amount of time it takes for 50% of a sample of radioactive isotope to decay.radiometric dating a method for determining the absolute age of rocks and fossils, based on the half-life of radioactive isotopes.Energy the capacity to cause change, especially to do work. (to move matter against an opposing force)Potential Energy The energy that matter possesses as a result of its location or spatial arrangement (structure)How does potential energy correlate with electrons in an atom? the negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positively charged nucleus. It takes work to move a electron away from the nucleus. Therefor the more distant an electron is from the nucleus the greater its potential energy. This can only occur in fixed amounts.Electron Shell an energy level of electrons at a characteristic average distance from the nucleus of an atom.What shell do the chemical behavior of an atom depends on? The outer most shellvalence electrons an electron in the outermost electron shellvalence shell the outermost energy shell of an atom, containing the valence electrons involved in the chemical reactions of that atom.Inert chemically unreactiveOrbital the three-dimensional space where an electron is found 90% of the timeA lithium atom has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. What is its mass number? ...A nitrogen atom has 7 protons, and the most common isotope of nitrogen has 7 neutrons. A radioactive isotope of nitrogen has 8 neutrons. write the atomic number and mass number of this radioactive nitrogen as a chemical symbol with a subscript and superscript. ...How many electrons does fluorine have? How many electrons shells? Name the orbitals that are occupied. How many electrons are needed to fill the valence shell? ...Chemical Bonds an attraction between two atoms, resulting from a sharing of outer-shell electrons or the presence of opposite charges on the atoms. The bonded atoms gain complete outer electron shells.Covalent bond A type of strong chemical bond in which two atoms share one or more pairs of valence electrons.molecule two or more atoms held together by covalent bondsSingle bond a single covalent bond the sharing of a pair of valence electrons by two atoms.double bond a double covalent bond; the sharing of two pairs of valence electrons by two atoms.valence the bonding capacity of a given atom; usually equals the number of unpaired electrons required to complete the atom's outermost (valence) shell.electronegativity the attraction of a given atom for the electrons of a covalent bondNon-polar covalent bond a type of covalent bond in which electrons are shared equally between two atoms of similar electronegativity.polar covalent bond a covalent bond between atoms that differ in electronegativity. The shared electrons are pulled closer to the more electronegative atom, making it slightly negative and the other atom slightly positive.ions an atoms or group of atoms that has gained or lost one or more electrons thus acquiring a charge.Cation a positively charged ionanion a negatively charged ionionic bond a chemical bond resulting from the attraction between oppositely charged ionsionic compounds a compound resulting from the formation of an ionic bond; also called salt.Hydrogen bond A type of weak chemical bond that is formed when the slightly positive hydrogen atom of a polar covalent bond in one molecule is attracted to the slightly negative atom of a polar covalent bond in another molecule or in another region of the same molecule.van der Waals interactions weak attractions between molecules or parts of molecules that result from transient local partial charges.why does the structure H--C=C--H fail to make sense chemically? ...What holds the atoms together in a crystal of magnesium chloride? ...If you were a pharmaceutical researcher, why would you want to learn the three-dimensional shapes of naturally occurring signaling molecules? ...Chemical reactions the making and breaking of chemical bonds, leading to changes in the composition of matter.reactants a starting material in a chemical reactionsproducts a material resulting from a chemical reactionChemical equilibrium in a chemical reaction, the state in which the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction, so that the relative concentrations of the reactants and products do not change with time.Which type of chemical reaction occurs faster at equilibrium, the formation of products from reactants or reactants from products? ...Write an equation that uses the products of photosynthesis as products. Add energy as another product. This new equation describes a process that occurs in your cells. Describe this equation in words. How does this equation relate to breathing? ..."
