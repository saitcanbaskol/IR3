Read/write Variant.Syntaxexpression. OpenArgsexpression A variable that represents a Form object.RemarksThis property is available only by using a macro or by using Visual Basic with the OpenForm method of the DoCmd object. This property setting is read-only in all views.To use the OpenArgs property, open a form by using the OpenForm method of the DoCmd object and set the OpenArgs argument to the desired string expression. The OpenArgs property setting can then be used in code for the form, such as in an Open event procedure. You can also refer to the property setting in a macro, such as an Open macro, or an expression, such as an expression that sets the ControlSource property for a control on the form.For example, suppose that the form you open is a continuous-form list of clients. If you want the focus to move to a specific client record when the form opens, you can set the OpenArgs property to the client's name, and then use the FindRecord action in an Open macro to move the focus to the record for the client with the specified name.ExampleThe following example uses the OpenArgs property to open the Employees form to a specific employee record and demonstrates how the OpenForm method sets the OpenArgs property. You can run this procedure as appropriate â€” for example, when the AfterUpdate event occurs for a custom dialog box used to enter new information about an employee.Sub OpenToCallahan () DoCmd.OpenForm ""Employees"", acNormal, , , acReadOnly, _ , ""Callahan"" End Sub Sub Form_Open (Cancel As Integer) Dim strEmployeeName As String ' If OpenArgs property contains employee name, find ' corresponding employee record and display it on form. For ' example,if the OpenArgs property contains ""Callahan"", ' move to first ""Callahan"" record. strEmployeeName = Forms!Employees.OpenArgs If Len (strEmployeeName) > 0 Then DoCmd.GoToControl ""LastName"" DoCmd.FindRecord strEmployeeName, , True, , True, , True End If End SubThe following example shows how to use the OpenArgs property to prevent a form from being opened from the Navigation Pane.Sample code provided by: The Microsoft Access 2010 Programmer's ReferencePrivate Sub Form_Open (Cancel As Integer)  If Me.OpenArgs () <> ""Valid User"" Then  MsgBox ""You are not authorized to use this form!"", _  vbExclamation + vbOKOnly, ""Invalid Access""  Cancel = True End If End SubAbout the ContributorsWrox Press is driven by the Programmer to Programmer philosophy.
