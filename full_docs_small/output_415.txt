"By James MartinUpdated 06/14/17Share Pin Email•••.Cologne is located in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia along the Rhine river between Dusseldorf and Bonn. Founded by Romans, it's one of Germany's oldest cities.The Gothic Cathedral of Cologne started construction in 1248 and wasn't finished until 1880; it is a UNESCO World Heritage site and Germany's most visited landmark. Adjacent to the cathedral is the modern Römisch-Germanisches Museum, its vast collections reflecting the Roman underpinnings of ancient Cologne, called by the Romans Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium.While these two attractions are enough for a full day if you're really interested in the ancient culture and religious structures, Cologne has much more to offer the visitor, as noted below.Cologne is Germany's fourth-largest city with a population of 1.8 million people. The historic center is easily walkable, however.The Tourist OfficeThe Tourist Office is located at Unter Fettenhennen 19, just southwest of the train station. It's open 9 am to 10 pm in summer, and 9 am to 9 pm in winter, except for Sundays and public holidays, when it's open 10 am to 6 pm. They will help you make same-day hotel reservations.

See Cologne weather and climate information.Library and Internet AccessFree internet access is available at the Cologne Public Library (StadtBibliothek Köln), one of the biggest in Germany. There is a wireless LAN there, as well as international newspapers.Cologne: Major AttractionsThe Cologne Cathedral - Cologne's Gothic Cathedral is one of its top attractions. It took over 600 years to build and is a UNESCO world heritage site. Conveniently located right next to the train station. In 2000, the Cathedral treasures were placed in a historic vaulted chamber so folks could view them easier. If you can climb 509 steps you'll get a good view of Cologne on the observation platform. Open 6 am to 7:30 pm for viewing, except during mass. Bring a wide-angle lens if you want to get it all in the picture, or you'll end up with an impressionistic shot like this picture of the Cologne Cathedral and its soaring spires.Rhine Boat Trips - lots of day trips and longer excursions are available. Ask at the tourist office.Visit the house of 4711, the Original Eau-de-Cologne - Wilhelm Mulhens marketed a concoction called Aqua Mirabilis on the basis of its stimulating and refreshing effect (splash it on or drink it, it didn't matter). It later got to be known as the first Eau de Cologne when French Revolutionary troops sent it home for gifts to the family. Glockengasse, in the city center between the cathedral and Neumarkt, opposite the opera house.Have a brew and a bite to eat in the Altstadt (old town) - Cologne is definitely a beer city with their own beer style called Kölcsh, a pale top-fermented beer that must be brewed in the Cologne metropolitan area. While most of the breweries in the city center are gone, you can still enjoy a beer with other tourists at a pub in the Altstadt.Visit the Roman-German Museum (Romisch-Germanisches Museum) - See Roman antiquities from the first through fourth centuries--and the 230-foot long mosaic showing Dionysus, the Roman god of wine.
