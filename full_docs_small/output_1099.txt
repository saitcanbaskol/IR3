[6] Fronted by singer-songwriter Jay Kay, the band's best-known line-up were additionally composed of co-songwriter Toby Smith  ( keyboard ), Stuart Zender  ( bass ), Derrick McKenzie ( drums) and Wallis Buchanan ( vibraphone / didgeridoo ).  [7] The group has changed its line-up several times; with McKenzie and Sola Akingbola ( percussion ), who both joined in 1994, still in the official line-up. They debuted as an acid-jazz band and have since explored other musical directions such as pop, rock, disco and electronica. Their sound has led to press comparing the group with American musician Stevie Wonder.  [7]  [8]  [9]They rose to international fame in the 1990s as one of the most prominent components in the London-based funk/acid jazz movement.  [10] Their 1996 album Travelling Without Moving, had entered the Guinness World Records as the best-selling funk album in history.  [11] Jamiroquai has thus sold more than 26 million albums worldwide.  [12] Front-man Kay won a BMI Presidents Award, ""in recognition of his profound influence on songwriting within the music industry;"" and with the band, also won an Ivor Novello Award for "" [an] Outstanding Song Collection"", as well as 13 Brit Award nominations during the course of their career.Contents [ hide ]1 History1.1 1991–1999: Formation and breakthrough1.2 2001–2011: Release from Sony Music1.3 2017–present: Automaton2 Discography3 Members4 Awards and Nominations5 See also6 External links7 ReferencesHistory  [ edit]1991–1999: Formation and breakthrough  [ edit]The band's script and logo, designed by Kay  [13]After a failed audition to become a singer of the Brand New Heavies,  [14] songwriter Jason ""Jay"" Kay formed Jamiroquai alongside co-songwriter and keyboardist Toby Smith, Stuart Zender on bass guitar, didgeridoo player Wallis Buchanan and drummer Nick van Gelder,  [15] who left shortly after the group's first album. The band's name is an interlock of the words, "" jam "" and ""iroquai"", the latter is based on the Iroquois, a Native American tribe.  [16] Being the front-man, Kay is occasionally referred to as 'Jamiroquai', due to misconception that the band is a solo artist.  [17]Kay's home demos were noticed by Acid Jazz Records, and under that label, Jamiroquai's first single "" When You Gonna Learn "", was released in 1992. Following its success, Kay signed a US$1 million record deal with Sony Soho 2.  [6]Emergency on Planet Earth, was released in 1993 and reached the UK albums chart at number 1.  [18] The album, according to BBC Music, ""laid the foundations"" for an acid-jazz sound that the band would continue to build upon for the next decade.  [19] They would also ""turn out gritty organic grooves with enthusiasm,"" in the opinion of Marisa Fox of Entertainment Weekly.  [20] The album's second single, "" Too Young to Die "" entered the UK singles chart at number 10.  [21]It was followed by The Return of the Space Cowboy, released in 1994. Rolling Stone described the album as ""jazzy soul pop"" with a live sound that ""glows"".  [22] John Bush of AllMusic would also say that they ""refused to be known as simply a party band"", the lyrics of the album discuss social issues.  [23] The song ""Manifest Destiny"" touches on slavery. Termed as a "" white guilt "" song, Kay said, ""When you learn how [cruel] history has been to some people [...] you get a perspective on why the world is like it is.""  [9] ""Manifest Destiny"" was sampled by 2Pac, with the album track ""Morning Glory"" additionally being sampled by Missy Elliot for her album Supa Dupa Fly.  [24]  [8] The single "" Space Cowboy "", is the group's first number 1 in the US Dance Chart;  [25] while "" Stillness in Time "" was another UK top ten hit, peaking at number 9.  [26]Jamiroquai - Virtual InsanitySample of "" Virtual Insanity "" from the 1996 album Travelling Without Moving. The popularity of this song was boosted by its music video.Jamiroquai - Cosmic GirlSample of "" Cosmic Girl ""; a disco song based on rhythmic ""looped beats"" to ""create a feeling of outer space.""  [27]Problems playing these files? See media help.With Jamiroquai growing in popularity in Europe and Japan, their American breakthrough came with the 1996 album, Travelling Without Moving.  [7] It reached number 24 in the US Billboard 200, and number 2 in the UK albums chart.  [28]  [18] A review from Q magazine stated that the album is ""tighter and more compact in its production"",  [29] while music journalist Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that despite having ""more fully realised"" fusions, it doesn't have ""the uniform consistency of its predecessor.""  [30] The album is described by Vibe magazine as having a lighter sound, as Kay stated that he was tired of being a ""troubadour of social conscience"".  [9] The album yielded two big hits: "" Virtual Insanity "" and "" Cosmic Girl "". The success of the former song was due in part of its music video.  [31] Directed by Jonathan Glazer, Kay: ""performed in a room where the floors, walls and furniture all moved simultaneously.""  [32] ""Virtual Insanity"" remains a popular track. It sold 356,000 copies and is streamed 4.5 million times as of 2014.  [31] The song was also number 1 in Italy.  [33] ""Cosmic Girl"" peaked at number 6 and remained in the chart for 12 weeks.  [34] It is a disco song;  [35] a style that the band would incorporate to their sound since its release. During this period, Kay was lambasted by press for hypocrisy. The group's earlier lyrics contained themes of environmental concern; and by the time Travelling Without Moving was released, he developed a passion for sports cars.  [36]  [14]A 1998 single titled, "" Deeper Underground "" was issued and was listed in the Godzilla soundtrack.  [37] The 1999 single "" Canned Heat "" was their second number 1 in the U.S. Dance Chart,  [38] and was also included in the soundtrack for the 2004 cult film Napoleon Dynamite.  [39] Their fourth studio album, Synkronized was released in 1999. Rolling Stone called it a ""party album"",  [40] that also "" [redirected] the band's British tendency toward smoothed-out old black jams..."" according to Spin Magazine.  [41] Bassist Stuart Zender left Jamiroquai during the production of the album, and was replaced by Nick Fyffe to record new sessions. The success of Synkronized in the US was limited due to non-music press coverage, including Kay assaulting a tabloid photographer.  [7]  [42]2001–2011: Release from Sony Music  [ edit]Jamiroquai performing at the Congress Theater in Chicago (2005)Their follow-up, A Funk Odyssey was released in September 2001. Slant Magazine commented that the album ""mixes self-samplage with Jamiroquai’s now-signature robo-funk"";  [43] Q also dubbed it as ""Sci-fi Boogie"".  [44] Both the album and its single "" Little L "" were in Top 100 charts worldwide.  [45] Songwriter and keyboardist Toby Smith left the band in 2002.  [46] A compilation titled Late Night Tales: Jamiroquai  (2003) under Azuli Records, contains a selection of the band's soul, funk and disco influences; including tracks from The Pointer Sisters, The Commodores, and Johnny ""Hammond"" Smith.  [47]The band's 2005 single, "" Feels Just Like It Should "", received a Grammy nomination for Best Short Form Music Video.  [48] Their sixth album titled Dynamite, was later released. Recorded in various locations, including their studio in Buckinghamshire, it is predominantly a disco and electronic album.  [7] It reached number 3 on the UK chart.  [18] The track, "" Seven Days in Sunny June "" is featured in the soundtrack for The Devil Wears Prada.  [49] Since the release of Dynamite, the group's line-up has consisted of Kay, drummer Derrick McKenzie, Rob Harris on guitar, keyboardist Matt Johnson, Paul Turner on bass guitar, and percussionist Sola Akingbola.In March 2006, Jamiroquai announced their switch to Columbia Records.  [50] A greatest hits collection, High Times: Singles 1992–2006, was released in November and marked the end of Kay's contract with Sony. It topped the UK album chart after its first week of release,  [18] and is certified triple platinum by the BPI.  [51] Kay stated that he considered retirement from his music career after leaving Sony and that the compilation was issued out of contractual obligation.  [52]  [53] In 2007, Jamiroquai performed in Gig in the Sky, in association with Sony Ericsson. They formerly held the Guinness World Record for the highest ever concert performed on aircraft.  [54]Jamiroquai performing in Sofia, Bulgaria (2013)In September 2010, Kay was featured on The Chris Moyles Show, and the song "" White Knuckle Ride "" was played on air live for the first time;  [55] which would be on Rock Dust Light Star, issued under Mercury Records. Music journalist Matt Collar said that the band were ""heading back to its rock and organic soul roots,""  [56] and journalist Thomas H. Green called the album ""a more organically recorded set of songs [with] Seventies funk rock flavours.""  [57] In the same year, the band worked with Julian Perretta and produced his début album Stitch Me Up.  [58] Jamiroquai also uploaded a 2011 track called ""Smile"" for free download via their SoundCloud page.  [59]2017–present: Automaton  [ edit]On 16 January 2017, Jamiroquai released an online short teaser video for their eighth and first studio album in seven years, Automaton, scheduled for a March release.  [60]  [61] In the following week, the album's eponymous single was issued,  [62] followed up by "" Cloud 9 "" in February.  [63] An Exclaim! review of the album stated that the band ""carefully balance [s] their signature sound"" with EDM and trap music.  [64] The album continued Kay's statements of social and personal concerns in his lyrics. The song ""Dr. Buzz"" is about racism and gun violence, and ""Nights Out in the Jungle"" references Kay's past struggles with drug addiction.  [65] The eponymous single recognises ""the rise of artificial intelligence and technology...""  [66] Although not released as a single, ""Shake it On"" broke into the Official French Singles Chart, peaking at number 154.  [67] In May, Kay seriously injured his spine, requiring surgery; it led to cancellation of shows in Tokyo and London for their Automaton Tour, which were rescheduled in September and December respectively.  [68]  [69]In January 2018, a song titled, ""Now We Are Alone"", originally an out-take from Automaton was made available for streaming via the band's official YouTube page, and is the first in a series of upcoming bonus tracks.
