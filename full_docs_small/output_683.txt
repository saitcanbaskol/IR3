"S.A.V.E.D. Spay and Neuter Clinic is a non-profit organization that opened its doors to the public in 2011. We offer low cost spay and neuter services to low income residents of Stanislaus County in the Central Valley of California. The organization was started by two local veterinarians who saw a need for these services for low income families. Dr. Craig Brooks and Dr. Michael O'Brien run the organization as well as donate their time and services by performing spays and neuters at our facility. Our organization's ultimate goal is to lower the pet overpopulation problem in Stanislaus County and as a result, lower the euthanasia rates in our local shelters.S.A.V.E.D.
