"I have had an appraisal completed for a pending divorce situation. I (my attorney) hired the appraiser and upon completion I reviewed it. Having many years of real estate brokerage and mortgage brokerage ownership (and enough appraisal knowledge to be dangerous) I am asking those here who do this full time and are current in their practices to help me decipher these issues: 1. Subject 2.32 acres (double lot compared to rest of subdivision) Comparables 1.04 acre, .90 acre, .76 acre, .64 acre, .58 acre and .45 acre. The appraiser made NO adjustment for lot size. Also, although the survey is not filed with the courthouse there was 1.13 acres surveyed off to sell someday as a new lot for building. He discounts this fact or valuation also. 2. Ex wife who lives in the home (I don't have access to view it with appraiser or anyone else) delivered to appraiser a roofing estimate (probably the highest one she could get) for $10,000. Appraiser adjusted my valuation down $10,000 however he was unable to visually inspect her claim as a snow storm hit a day before and all pictures, his written commentary and a phone conversation with me confirmed he saw nothing, but ""needed to rely on her estimate"". This morning I discussed the issue with an appraiser friend who has been doing this for 30 years full time. The appraiser in question is basically a 'financial consultant' rolling over 401K's. The appraiser I discussed these issues with said the appraisal was full of other holes besides these I found, most importantly ethics and how the appraisal 'could' be used in the future, not conforming to FNMA guidelines if such, and he stated none of his clients would have accepted this appraisal. What are your thoughts? Subdivision of a bedroom community in Wisconsin, not far from the Mississippi River in the Coulee Region with views. I understand you don't have the full appraisal, but do you see ethics issues, how do I approach the appraiser who did this, did he really screw up? Thanks in advance, Terry"
