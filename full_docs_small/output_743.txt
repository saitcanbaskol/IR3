Today the cramps have gone?? i was wondering when did you ovulate after +opk?Hi there, OPK detects LH Surge, which in most cases occurs 12-36 hours BEFORE ovulation....if you got your OPK at 8.45 am yesterday morning, you could expect to ovulate anywhere between yesterday evening to tonight! There are some anomolies to this of course, some women may ovulate a little sooner than 8 hours after their positive OPK and some women may ovulate as many as 48 hours after....this is largely due to the fact that a positive OPK is only a SNAPSHOT of your LH surge, you may have caught your surge at the beginning or the end depending on what time of day you tested, most manufacturers advice to test around 4pm, as this is when most surge's are at their peak! I tend to get my surge around 2-3pm on the day of or the day before ovulation....and sometimes will ovulate during the night after my surge! Hope this helps...and good luck!Status: OfflineFeb 11th, 2011, 07:15 AM 3michelleclareMum (Mom)Active BnB MemberJoin Date: Jan 2011Location: poole,ukPosts: 547Quote:Originally Posted by SweedotQuote:Originally Posted by michelleclareHey ladies i got a +opk yesterday morning at 8:45am, i had lots of cramps on that day and the 2 days before.
