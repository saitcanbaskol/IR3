Acceptable theories of justices provide a framework which (1) is able to count the wrongs  done to dead victims as wrongs, and (2) would not encourage the dead perpetrators to act  unjustly, had the framework been publicly known to the dead. A theory of justice should  be judged by its publicity effects, but publicity effects should not be confined to the  living. My approach generates reasons to think in some ways rather than others about  wrongs that were committed in the past, and about their enduring consequences.      1 Disrespect Towards the Dead: Constraints on Acceptable Frameworks of Justice   Liberal theories of justice are generally forward-looking, concerned with the  claims, interests, well-being, or rights of living and future individuals.1 In this article I  argue that this is not completely sufficient, that we have sound reason to avoid various  forms of disrespect towards the dead. I first examine the accounts of two historical  figures, Immanuel Kant and his contemporary Johann Fichte, taking them as models of  thinking about justice and the dead. Understanding the form of each of their arguments  makes clear the form of my argument, which holds that acceptable theories of justice  have certain structural constraints. We should consider how our theory of justice, if it had  held in a past context, would have treated then-living and then-future individuals. Would  it have counted as wrong the wrongs suffered by the then-living? Would it have  adequately discouraged injustice to the then-living by having sufficient duties of  reparation following the wrong? If not, we can display disrespect toward the dead now.  My approach generates reasons for us to think in some ways rather than others about  wrongs that were committed in the past, and about their enduring consequences.    Fichte and the Social Contract Approach   Fichte holds that the dead lack a basic moral status which would ground claims of  justice. The living, however, can optionally protect their own interests, if they enact a law  with universal application, thereby treating the dead with respect. Fichte’s account  1  A weaker version has living and future individuals as the primary focus, leaving open  the possibility of counting recently dead individuals. See Thomas Pogge, World Poverty  and Human Rights (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers, 2002), 248 n68.     2 importantly relies on the existence of a concrete social morality in the world. I do not  adopt the specifics of Fichte’s account, but I will often refer back to its structure in the  course of this paper.   Fichte asks why the living should honor the will of the deceased in cases of  testaments. Fichte suggests it may be to the advantage of living persons that there be a  belief that testaments are valid. They might, for example, receive better care and devotion  from relatives: “In short, this belief in the validity of testaments is a benefit to the living,  who may very well have a right to this benefit… The issue here has nothing to do with  the rights of the deceased (they have no rights), but only the rights of the living.”2   Without considering the rights of the living, Fichte does think we have any basis  for saying the dead have rights. For Fichte, the concept of justice or Right [Recht]3  applies only if two parties are in reciprocal interaction with one another in the physical     2  Johann Fichte, Foundations of Natural Right, trans. Michael Baur (Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 2000), 224. Fichte emphasizes improving the treatment of  the living while they live. An alternative social contract account suggests that persons,  while alive, have an interest in what happens after their deaths. See Ernest Partridge,  ""Posthumous Interests and Posthumous Respect,"" Ethics, 91 (1981), 243-64. 3  Recht is a German word without an exact English translation. It is a mixture of “Right,”  “justice,” and “law.” It is equivilent to the Latin Ius. Recht or “Right” is not the same as  the plural rights. The two are, however, related. See the editorial introduction to Fichte,  Foundations.     3 world.4 The dead are not in such a relationship with the living. The living may have  duties of conscience towards the dead, but these are not duties of justice.   Fichte says that when human beings “have a need to believe in the validity of  testaments” they will make provision for it in the social contract.5 Relations of justice or  Right [Recht] can exist without such provision, so it is an optional, not a necessary, part  of the social contract. 6 So if members want to receive the benefits of belief in  testamentary rights, they must legislate its validity. “But any such belief concerning the  validity of testaments can arise only if testaments are valid according to a law, i.e. valid  without exception… And so, for their own sake, all guarantee the validity of the  decedent's last will. By guaranteeing this, they also guarantee the validity of their own  last will; the decedent's rights are bound to the rights of the citizens who survive him.”7  Fichte says that it is the universal will that binds, rather than the will of the deceased.  This universal will binds living persons, subjecting them to duties, and also binds the  state, which would otherwise inherit the property.8 This legislating universal will is the  will of the living and concerns the shared interest they have in there being a shared public  belief in the validity of testaments.     4  Ibid., 224. 5  Fichte refers specifically to the “property contract,” since there are a series of contracts  in his social contract theory. I ignore that complication here. 6  Fichte, Foundations, 224. 7  Ibid., 225. 8  Ibid.     4  If the now-living have an interest in the validity of testaments, then they have an  interest in there being a concrete social morality declaring the validity of testaments after  their death, which in turn requires that the interests of the dead are to be treated with  respect now. Further, a state that decrees that a belief in testaments is valid must also  declare the extent to which they are valid – it must enact specific legislation. This results  in a concrete system of rights and duties. Moral philosophers might talk about morality in  a transcendental sense, as if it consists in abstract standards. Here, in contrast, we are  talking about a system of justice publicly adopted as the official one by a society. With  the social contract approach, respect for the dead (or its equivalent) must be a specific  practice in the world with wide validity and consistent application if this practice is to  exist.    Kant and the Moral Status of the Dead   Unlike Fichte, Kant suggests that the living can directly injure the dead, as the  dead have a moral status that should be respected. The same features that ground the  moral status of the living also ground the moral status of the dead. In Kant’s framework,  respecting the living presupposes respecting the dead. The form of Kant’s argument  suggests a lesson I will use in my own account.   Kant says that a dead person can be robbed of his honor by a slanderer, by being  deprived of his good name, by a malicious (and false) rumor.9 Every person is born with     9  Immanuel Kant, Practical Philosophy, trans. Mary Gregor (Cambridge: Cambridge  University Press, 1996), 442n, 6:296 MM §35. Citations to The Metaphysics of Morals     5 an entitlement to a good reputation.10 A human being is originally “beyond reproach” in  that he has not done wrong to anyone before he does any juridical acts.11 To be beyond  reproach is part of the innate right of freedom, which belongs to “every man by virtue of  his humanity.”12 As I discuss below, someone’s humanity refers in this context to his  personality.13 Kant says: “A person is a subject whose actions can be imputed to him.”14  A free being is the author of his actions and only his actions. Even after his death, a dead  person still can be thought of as having done right or wrong actions. Assuming a person  does no wrong in his life, his good reputation continues to be attached to his “person”  after he physically ceases to exist.   Kant claims that if someone slanders me after my death, he still wrongs me. Kant  writes: “in a relation purely of rights, which is entirely intellectual, abstraction is made   will first list the page number of the Cambridge edition, then the Academy edition  number, the abbreviation “MM”, and (where appropriate) the section number. 10  Kant says that “a good reputation is an innate external belonging, though an ideal one  only, which clings to the subject as a person, a being of such a nature that I can and must  abstract from whether he ceases to be entirely at his death or whether he survives as a  person; for in the context of his rights in relations to others, I actually regard every person  simply in terms of his humanity, hence as homo noumenon.” See ibid., 441-42, 6:295  MM §35. 11  Ibid., 394, 6:238 MM. 12  Ibid., 393, 6:237 MM. 13  Ibid., 395, 6:239 MM. 14  Ibid., 378, 6:224 MM.     6 from any physical conditions (of time), and whoever robs me of my honor (a slanderer) is  just as punishable as if he had done it during my lifetime…”15 In the realm of Right   [Recht] or justice, we abstract from time and space to consider whether a wrong is done.16  Kant uses this general procedure when discussing property rights and contract rights  among the living. Someone wrongs me when he trespasses on my land, even when I am  not physically connected to it.17 Such abstraction is crucial to the concept of Right.   To be sure, the types of wrongs that can be done to a person diminish vastly after  his death. For Kant, property rights to physical things cannot exist after death.18 However,  a defense of my name, even after my death, brings me satisfaction through righting a  wrong. Anyone, not just relatives, is authorized to play the role of apologist for the dead.  Note that publicly calling someone a liar for falsely speaking ill of the dead takes away  the liar’s honor. An apologist for the dead could do this, and thereby punish the liar, if  she “could rightly assume that the dead man [was] wronged by” the lie, owing not to a  duty of virtue but to “the right of humanity as such.”19     15  Ibid., 442, 6:296 MM §35. 16  On translating Recht, see the note in the section on Fichte above. 17  Kant, Practical Philosophy, 401, 6:245 MM §1. 18  It might be objected that the goods in a deceased person’s estate still belong to him  before they are distributed to his heirs. But this is not Kant’s view. At the moment of  death, the heir acquires the exclusive right to accept the goods. The state stops others  from acquiring the goods in the meantime. Ibid., 440-41, 6:294 MM §34. 19  Ibid., 442, 6:296 MM §35.     7  Kant says that there are two ways of seeing a human being. A homo noumenon is  a human being seen in terms of “his humanity, his personality independent of physical  attributes…” This is to be “distinguished from the same subject represented as affected  by physical attributes, a human being (homo phaenomenon).”20 A person can be seen in  terms of his humanity, even after his death, since his humanity is personality independent  of physical attributes.   I am not arguing for adopting Kant’s specific account. Rather, I want to use his  account to suggest a form of an argument. We need not say the dead are harmed or  wronged simply because we, the living, deny that they hold a moral status that makes  them worthy of respect. Instead, we can hold that the dead being accorded a certain status  is (or is bound up with) a presupposition of our consistently using a certain framework.  The right of humanity is a linchpin of Kant’s concept of Right or justice. 21 Kant  specifically mentions how all human beings have an innate right of freedom, which  belongs to them by virtue of their “humanity.”22 On Kant’s account, it is not so much that  we have an interest in practices that recognize the dead as having humanity (though we  do have that). Rather, the status that accords rights refers to humanity, and this refers  specifically to persons, be they alive or dead. On this logic, we cannot consistently deny  the humanity of a dead human being and restrict respect to the living, because his  20  Ibid., 395, 6:239 MM. 21  Rosen’s account of duties to the dead also relies on Kant and the respect owed to  humanity. He does not focus on the concept of Right, my concern here. Michael Rosen,  Dignity (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2012). 22  Kant, Practical Philosophy, 393, 6:237 MM.     8 humanity is independent of his physical attributes, including whether a person is  physically alive. The concept of Right or justice involves abstracting from space and time  in examining whether wrong was done.   The point is not whether Kant has the correct framework. Kant’s moral concept of  Right may be optional in the sense that there are other candidate frameworks for  theorizing about justice. In this paper, I do not even assume Kant has the correct type of  framework for thinking about justice and rights. For example, Rawls’ method of  reflective equilibrium, discussed later, may be superior.23 The point is the form of the  argument: given the reasons for according the living status within a given framework,  consistency within that framework presupposes according status to the dead.   Unlike Kant, the type of framework with which I will be concerned about  undermining is not that of the mere concept of justice or Right. Unlike Fichte, I will not  be concerned simply with a concrete legislated system of rights and duties towards the  dead. I will discuss “frameworks of justice,” which are midway between that of Kant and  Fichte.   A “framework of justice,” as I use the term, is a particular conception of justice  that is publicly adopted for a society, social context, or set of social contexts.24 John  Rawls’ domestic theory of justice is an example of such a framework.25 A framework of  justice has two parts: First, it is a way of thinking about justice, with some basic  23  John Rawls, A Theory of Justice (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1971). 24  On a “framework of justice,” see Thomas Pogge, ""Making War on Terrorists,"" Journal  of Political Philosophy, 16 (2008), 1-25. 25  Rawls, Theory.     9 commitments or guiding lights that animate it. It provides the public criterion for  regulating and evaluating social practices and institutional schemes.26 Second, when these  general principles are articulated and made concrete, the framework also provides   (principles for) a specific system of rights and duties, which can be evaluated for its  concrete effects in the real world.27   Fichte discussed how a society could legislate a belief in the validity of respecting  the interests of those now dead. I will discuss how a society could commit itself to (or  “legislate”) the validity of a belief regarding respecting the moral status of those now  dead. A society can do so through upholding a certain framework of justice. I combine a  Kantian idea (that using a certain framework presupposes the dead having a moral status)  with a Fichtean idea (that the validity of a belief regarding respecting the dead is not  something given, but is officially adopted or legislated by a society).28   I will not offer a specific framework of justice. But I will suggest constraints for  acceptable frameworks of justice. I will argue that when a society adopts a certain  framework of justice, it can adopt an unjustified partiality towards the living. How a  framework of justice thinks about justice, and how it is articulated into a concrete system  of justice, should avoid disrespect towards the dead. The living are accountable for the  framework of justice they commit to upholding.     26  Pogge, World Poverty and Human Rights, Ch. 3. 27  Ibid. 28  This contrast may be overdrawn, as Kant also talks about self-legislation.     10 Disrespect Towards the Dead Within a Framework of Justice   In evaluating a framework of justice, we need to consider how it would have  treated the dead, had it been the framework under which the dead operated. (It might be  maintained that a theory of justice has a limited scope, and the framework of justice does  not apply to the context in which the dead lived; I discuss such cases nearer to the end of  the paper.) Even if justice should indeed be focused on the treatment of living and future  individuals, we should consider how our framework of justice, if embedded in a past  context, would have treated then-living and then-future individuals. This has two aspects.  One concerns the ability to sincerely count as wrong the wrongs suffered by dead victims.  The second concerns avoiding perverse incentives for the dead.   First, the framework of justice that a political society adopts for itself today has  implications for the types of past events the society can sincerely remember as having  been unjust. The framework makes claims about what past wrongs can be counted as  wrongs. If our framework of justice does not allow us to remember a past atrocity as  unjust, then those whom we want to count as victims of past injustice cannot be seen as  such under our theory of justice. Suppose that a framework of justice would not condemn  a past event that intuitively seems to be a great atrocity. In some sense, the framework of  justice displays disrespect towards the dead, since it cannot count them as victims of   (significant) wrongs. This can be compared to a teacher who sends a message to his class  that bullying certain students is not wrong or is not that big a deal. A framework of  justice should provide principles that enable us to condemn odious acts that we ought to  judge as unjust. It should also not treat lightly the occurrence of such events, but also (as  appropriate) condemn them not merely as wrong, but as seriously wrong.      11  For example: some global egalitarian theories of distributive justice might judge  that indigenous peoples once had a share of resources that was larger than the amount to  which they were entitled.29 A theory of equality of resources may count unused resources   (including large tracts of sacred land) as part of the wealth of indigenous peoples, wealth  to which other people in the world could be entitled.30 To the extent that views of justice  can legitimate coercion to realize justice, this could in turn imply that force might be  justified to rectify such an unjust distribution.31 If so, the state or theorist using that  theory of justice could not adequately encapsulate the complete injustice of colonialism.  At most, they could say the force used by colonists might have been ""excessive,"" but  allow that fundamentally the indigenous peoples were also unjust in not sharing their  resources.   Second, even if an event can be condemned as wrong, we can imagine what the  framework of justice would have encouraged or not adequately discouraged, had the dead  29  See Will Kymlicka, Politics in the Vernacular (Oxford: Oxford University Press,  2001); G. Peter Penz, ""Development Refugees and Distributive Justice,"" Public Affairs  Quarterly, 6 (1992), 105-31. Similarly, a left-libertarian theory might have such a strong  proviso that indigenous peoples are not allowed to have a (greatly) disproportionate share  of resources. I worry these may be the implications of Otsuka's egalitarian proviso. See  Michael Otsuka, Libertarianism without Inequality (Oxford: Clarendon, 2003). 30  Kymlicka says that there should “probably” be a ""resource tax” that would be in effect  even on unused resources. Kymlicka, Vernacular, 150. 31  My point is what a bad theory would look like, not to say Kymlicka and Otsuka are  examples of it.     12 known what duties of repair would or would not be demanded were an injustice to have  occurred. The framework may make it too easy to gain from that wrong, and may create  an incentive to do wrong.32 A framework might officially condemn an atrocity as an  injustice, but might not demand correction after its occurrence. A teacher might say that  the bully does not have to give back any of the money he took because he does not have  the money any more—even if he clearly has the candy he bought with it. Given the  publicly expressed (if perhaps only implicit) principle that the bully need not restore what  he no longer has, the bully has a perverse incentive in the future to continue snatching  lunch money and quickly spending it (or at least, he is not adequately discouraged from  doing so). A just system would have reason to allow the victimized child to have a claim  to restitution or compensation of some kind. A system that publicly announces otherwise  in some sense disrespects the victim. This is true even if it were the last day of class and  the victim and bully would never meet again.   Now, suppose that a new teacher teaches the class the following year. The  teacher’s system of discipline would have encouraged the bullying that took place in the  previous year, had it been in place then. If the new teacher upholds this disciplinary  system in his new class in a way that suggests it would be appropriate for the old classes,  he could be said to continue to display a certain sort of disrespect to students victimized     32  Thomas Pogge, ""The Effects of Prevalent Moral Conceptions,"" Social Research, 57   (1990), 649-63; Pogge, World Poverty and Human Rights, Ch. 3; Lea Ypi, Robert E.  Goodin, and Christian Barry, ""Associative Duties, Global Justice, and the Colonies,""  Philosophy and Public Affairs, 37 (2009), 103-35.     13 in the past.33 Of course, in one sense, there cannot literally be “incentives to act in the  past,” since past people will not act differently.34 Nonetheless, the teacher can signal what  he would have encouraged or not adequately discouraged in the past. A more specific  instance of “incentives to act in the past” is “incentives for the dead.”    Four Grounds for Counting the Dead   The above mentioned two aspects, ability to count as wrong the wrongs done to  the dead victims and avoiding perverse incentives for dead perpetrators, explain two core  parts of what I mean here by disrespect to the dead.35 But why should we care if the dead  are disrespected in a framework of justice? I explore four possible grounds.   The first possible reason does not assume duties are owed directly to the dead.  Rather, the duties presently living people have with regard to the dead are duties owed to  other presently living people, especially members of historically victimized groups. If  past discrimination is not repudiated, the members of a historically victimized group may  feel insecure, and may worry about future targeting. Forms of remembrance and even  reparations may be a way to assure members of historically victimized groups that the  33  Perhaps no such endorsement follows, as the context in which he teaches is  fundamentally different than the past context. Teaching in a foreign study program may  require a different system. I discuss context shifts below. 34  Mulgan argues “the dead are still with us.” However, even such dead cannot change  their past actions. Tim Mulgan, ""The Place of the Dead in Liberal Political Philosophy,""  Journal of Political Philosophy, 7 (1999), 52-70. 35  I do not claim these are the only, or even the most important, forms of disrespect.     14 state today will now treat them fairly. (Further, it may be important to their identity and  self-respect that a past event be remembered as unjust.36) Later in the paper, I discuss  how incorporating the status of the dead into a framework of justice can help provide this  assurance. This account is structurally similar to Fichte’s view that the needs of the living  generate an obligation to respect the dead. However, this cannot capture situations in  which all the members of the victimized group have died. If colonists kill all native  members of an island, is there any duty to remember this action as wrong? If genocide is  thoroughly successful, there are no members of the group left who might suffer harms.  Indeed, upholding this as the only ground of the duty to display respect toward the dead  may actually create an incentive for perpetrators to eliminate all members of a group.   The second possible reason assumes that the dead can be harmed or benefitted,  even apart from whether any particular living person is benefitted or is wrong or  harmed.37 On a popular account of what it means to harm or benefit the dead, living  36  Jeremy Waldron, ""Superseding Historic Injustice,"" Ethics, 103 (1992), 4-28. 37  For an overview, see Lukas H. Meyer, ""Intergenerational Justice,"" in Stanford  Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2008), §5. For an argument that the dead can be both  wronged and harmed, see George Pitcher, ""The Misfortunes of the Dead,"" American  Philosophical Quarterly, 21 (1984), 183-88. For a defense of direct obligations to the  dead, see Bob Brecher, ""Our Obligation to the Dead,"" Journal of Applied Philosophy, 19   (2002), 109-19. Aristotle famously said that one’s happiness could change after his death.  Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, trans. Terence Irwin, 2nd ed. (Indianapolis, IN: Hackett,  1999), I.10-11. Noting this, Kagan argues that a person’s life can go better because of  events after his death, even if his well-being cannot be changed thus. Shelley Kagan, ""Me     15 persons form interests while alive, and the thwarting of these interests constitutes harm,  even if this takes place after death.38 When a corpse is desecrated, the harm is not simply  that living people worry their corpses will suffer the same fate. When a deathbed promise  is not kept, the harm is not simply that living people worry about whether their last  wishes will be fulfilled. Conversely, we might be able to benefit the dead by furthering  their preferences or interests, such as making their descendants better off. A concern to  benefit the dead might justify reparations for slavery. 39 However, these accounts  problematically assume an interest can attach to a person after he or she no longer  exists.40 I prefer not to depend on this ground. My concern here is to present the most  minimal version: the dead can be harmed or wronged now if the living deny that they had  a moral status while alive. This is minimal because it does not mean (so far) that any  other interests survive past one’s death.   The third possible reason for avoiding disrespect towards to the dead concerns  duties we have towards ourselves. I particularly have in mind the ‘self’ as a political  society that is seen as existing over time. If a society adopts a framework of justice that   and My Life,"" Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 94 (New Series) (1994), 309-24.  For a recent attack on posthumous rights, see Stephen Winter, ""Against Posthumous  Rights,"" Journal of Applied Philosophy, 27 (2010), 186-99. 38  Joel Feinberg, Harm to Others: The Moral Limits of Criminal Law, vol. 1 (Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 1987), 79-95; Thomas Nagel, ""Death,"" Noûs, 4 (1970), 73-80. 39  Michael Ridge, ""Giving the Dead Their Due,"" Ethics, 114 (2003), 38-59 at 42. 40  Alternative accounts of wrong may suggest other ways to explain this ground, but my  purpose here is not to defend any one particular ground in great detail.     16 relies on false moral reasoning (for example, by not condemning a past atrocity), this  perhaps can only be done in a manner that either distorts the public political culture of  that society or is inconsistent with the self-image of that society. Hypocrisy can degrade  moral discourse in society.41 On the individual level, a person may owe it to herself to  keep a deathbed promise, even if no one would know if she did otherwise, for reasons of  integrity and character.42 She sees himself as the kind of person who would keep such a  promise (without making calculations at each instance). Similarly, if a society wants to be  entitled to a certain view of itself, it might need to adopt a certain stance and attitude.  Distortions in moral reasoning in the public political culture may result if the society  engages in self-deception. A political society can adopt different attitudes towards its past  and towards past atrocities. It should take into account at least the cases and experiences  it has faced in order to make sense of itself. Indeed, there may be an existential choice  about what sort of thing a society wants to be. To the extent that the experiences of the  dead victims of historical injustice are left out of the self-understanding of a society, this  can be a violation of a duty to the living successors of the historical victims, or towards  the dead, but it can also violate the self-understanding of that particular society.43  41  Pogge, ""Making War on Terrorists."" 42  See Williams’ account of integrity in J. J. C. Smart and Bernard Williams,  Utilitarianism for and Against (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973). 43  Rather than seeing this as a duty society as a whole has to itself, we can instead see this  as a duty individual citizens have. Citizens may have a duty in their role as citizens to  adopt certain types of public reasoning, assuming they wish to be citizens of this society  and see their society in a certain way.     17  The fourth possible reason to avoid disrespect towards the dead involves arguing  that the authority of the moral framework that we are using depends on incorporating  respect for the dead into it. Respect for the dead is not a duty, but a presupposition of  adopting a certain framework of justice. We saw this type of argument when examining  Kant’s account. We can undermine morality, or at least the moral framework through  which we approach issues of justice, by denying the status of the dead. If what is wrong  and right is in part determined by the larger of theory of justice we construct for ourselves,  then we can be accountable for not considering the status of the dead when constructing  such a theory of justice.44 Again, this does not necessarily get us towards the idea that the  dead have posthumous rights or interests, or that they should be treated as if they do.  Rather, it minimally says that a theory of justice that provides a concrete framework of  justice should not withdraw the status that dead victims had while alive, the status which  allowed us to say they were wronged and were victims.    Four Structural Constraints on Frameworks of Justice   Each of these grounds can establish the following postulate: the once-living were  entitled to a certain sort of respect when alive, and the now-living ought to display a  44  The argument supposes either that a theory of justice is constructed or that one has  duties regarding how one thinks about justice in the absence of complete knowledge of  the ultimate principles of justice. Thus, anti-constructivists about justice might be able to  adopt modified versions of my arguments. Cf. G. A. Cohen, ""Constructivism,"" in  Rescuing Justice and Equality (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2008), 274-  343.     18 certain type of respect towards those now dead. Minimally, we disrespect the dead now  when we deny that they suffered injustice when alive.45   This need not yet make any assumption that there are other duties towards the  dead that continue past the death of the individual.46 Nothing said so far need involve the  view that the dead continue, today, to have claims to reparations for injustices that  survive their deaths. Indeed, establishing that the once-living have (or had) moral status  does not yet give us a reason to honor dying wishes or to not dishonor corpses. Any  claims for reparations arguably could die with the victim. My argument so far is  independent of any assertions about what claims the dead (or their descendants) now have  on the living. The only reference to a wrong is to the injustice suffered by the once-living  in their own time (though this does not exclude the possibility that we wrong the dead  now by effectively denying they were wronged in the past).47 In this way, my starting  point more precisely concerns how to count the once-living, rather than the dead.  45  Here, I am remaining neutral between whether there is a direct duty to the dead, or  merely an indirect duty with regard to the dead. It depends on which of the grounds we  invoke. 46  On such “surviving duties,” see Lukas H. Meyer, ""Surviving Duties and Symbolic  Compensation,"" in Justice in Time, ed. Lukas Meyer (Baden-Baden: Nomos  Verlagsgesellshaft, 2004), 173-83. 47  The claim that those now dead had a status while alive is be distinguished from the  claim that those now dead still retain a status. I start from the former, so my account  differs from W. James Booth, ""'From This Far Place': On Justice and Absence,""  American Political Science Review, 105 (2011), 750-64 at 752.     19  Nonetheless, it is assumed that the once-living were owed respect then, and our  framework of justice should display this attitude now towards the atrocities committed  against these victims. What I am saying so far is that acceptable frameworks of justice   (assuming they have a broad scope) have structural constraints: they must incorporate the  types of injustices suffered by the once-living into their theories.48 From this starting  point, my argument will eventually aim to establish the basis for claims for reparations  for wrongs done to the dead.   The first two structural constraints demand we avoid the two forms of disrespect  towards the dead discussed above. First, our framework should be able to count the  wrongs the dead suffered as wrongs (at least when we claim the scope of our theory is  also large enough to say that claims of reparations do or do not persist). Second, we  imagine how our framework might have encouraged certain injustices, if its system of  justice had been in place at the time of the past injustice. Our framework should avoid  perverse incentives for the dead.   The third structural constraint imagines what incentive effects would have existed  for past actors, had they known how present people would or would not have repaired the  injustice done to dead victims. This varies slightly from the above constraint, which deals  with applying a framework in a past context. In this constraint, we consider the publicity  effects our framework of justice would have had on the now dead, had they been aware  of how our framework would address claims stemming from wrongs done to people in  their time. In this respect, we should consider the message we send when we adopt a  48  Pogge similarly calls for a ""systematic coherence in morality"" in theories of justice.  See Pogge, World Poverty and Human Rights, 94.     20 system of principles that does not take any account of how the once-living perpetrators  would have had an incentive to do injustice. While the very denial of reparations may not  disrespect the dead, the way we justify the denial (or the way in which we do not even  consider the problem worthy of consideration) could send a message of disrespect; it  could indicate that our system of justice does not care about discouraging injustice. This  arguably disrespects the dead directly. It can also give their living successors less reason  to trust state authorities. It also can contradict the image a society holds of itself. In  circumstances of gross historical injustice, the legitimacy of the state depends on giving  assurance to those successors, in a way that is not the case in absence of this history. The  state should fairly treat the successors of victims of historical injustice by formulating a  framework of justice, which outlines what constitutes a wrong, and gives principles for  determining how claims of reparations for those wrongs might persist.   The fourth structural constraint is that we have a duty to reflect upon the wrong  done to these victims and incorporate these reflections into our framework of justice.  Now, we might deny that reparations for historical injustice are appropriate today in  particular cases; in itself, this does not mean we necessarily disrespect those dead victims.  However, our framework of justice, including the principles of reparative justice, should  incorporate the wrongs that were done to the dead. The grounds on which we do or do not  deny reparations should be part of a framework that does not involve, implicitly or  explicitly, disrespect for the dead.   However, it is not enough just to say or sincerely believe these past injustices  were unjust. It is not enough to have a “settled conviction” that a past event like the  coercive settlement of North America was wrong. We must not only count the wrongs      21 past victims suffered as wrongs. We must have general principles that account for the  supposedly settled conviction that these wrongs count as wrongs. If we do not, we must  either abandon these convictions or come up with such principles.49 We must be able to  say why such past events were wrong, not just that they were wrong.   For Rawls, the process of reflective equilibrium allows us to bring convictions  and principles into balance, and the chooser can choose which to keep and which to  change. However, such a choice also evinces attitudes to specific historical injustices and  towards the dead, which can have their own effects if publically known (I discuss this  further below).   Proposed principles of justice are like proposed rules of grammar, and past unjust  events are like instances of language use. Different rules of grammar might be  appropriate with a different universe of cases of language use. So adding or subtracting  cases of language use might change which rules of grammar best capture the universe of  cases. Similarly, adding or subtracting “settled convictions” changes the universe of cases  that it is claimed should be judged as unjust. This can change which principles of justice  best account for the relevant universe of cases.   Making certain cases suffered by dead victims into more central cases means that  we assess candidate principles of justice based on whether they better account for the  wrongfulness of these cases. Since we stand in special relation to the dead victims who  suffered through our own state's own actions, we have a special obligation to make     49  See Rawls, Theory, §9; I draw on Pogge, ""Making War on Terrorists,"" 4.     22 judgments about how they were or were not wronged.50 For us, their case is, other things  beings equal, a more central case than other dead victims. This can be a form of respect  towards the dead.   Frameworks of justice that incorporate such reflections about wrongs done to the  dead may differ from frameworks not incorporating such reflections. First, we have to  come up with principles for why these wrongs were wrongs, rather than just saying it was  wrong. Second, we may focus on certain cases, seeing them as more central than before.  Since principles, like rules of grammar, can only imperfectly capture the universe of  cases, making a case more central is important. By redirecting our reflection and  demanding that the general principles account for certain cases in particular, we may  indirectly be led to a new theory of justice through the process of reflective equilibrium.  Focusing on wrongs done to the dead, perhaps especially on those committed by our own  state, may result in a different system of justice. This different system of justice may have  different principles for reparations.    Surviving Duties of Reparation   I have already argued that we should not deny that the dead victim suffered wrong  while alive. If a framework of justice is silent on such a past injustice, this could  effectively say that such violations do not count, according the authority of the  framework. It might then be difficult to sincerely remember a past wrong as unjust.  50  Cf. Jürgen Habermas, ""On the Public Use of History,"" in The New Conservatism:  Cultural Criticism and the Historians' Debate (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1989),  229-40.     23 Indeed, this may undermine the authority of the framework. Further, if a framework of  justice judges past atrocities as wrong then, presumably, it should also admit that, while  alive, the victims potentially had claims of reparation following the wrong. Our  framework of justice should not now, in effect, withdraw the claims of reparation the  victims would have justly had against the original perpetrators.   The next question is whether it is disrespectful to hold that the claims of  reparation vanish after the death of the victim. It is at this point, and not before, that my  argument brings into play the concept of “surviving duties.”51 Meyer makes a general  claim that duties can survive the expiration of the person to or towards whom the duty  was owed. For example, we can continue to have a surviving duty to keep a promise we  made to someone on her deathbed, if the reasons that led to our acquiring that duty are  still relevant now. Meyer does not say much explicitly about what those reasons could be.  The candidate I offer for a reason for these surviving duties is that they derive from a  justified framework of justice, which is held to apply to the present as well as certain past  contexts. It tests this framework’s principles and their implications in these contexts. So it  considers the implications of the principles on a broad scale (as Rawls does in engaging  in reflective equilibrium). It considers not only what the theory directly declares wrong or  right or acceptable, but also its incentive effects. The theory should not make it too easy  to get away with doing wrong. Recall how a teacher who punishes a bully, but only  lightly, can send the signal that the victim is not as worthy of respect as somebody who  counts fully. If we are concerned about the incentive effects that our present theory gives  for all contexts for which it is relevant, including past contexts, then our system of  51  Meyer, ""Surviving Duties.""     24 principles should incorporate some discouragements. The motivation is to provide a  theory or framework of justice that is coherent across all contexts for which it claims  relevance.52 This must minimally include the context where the dead were wronged, if  our framework claims to address their reparative claims. This can provide the basis for  surviving duties.   In discussing the content of surviving duties, we should be concerned about  incentive effects, even when they are no longer likely to encourage or discourage  anything in the future. If a framework of justice is public, then there are publicity effects.  Successors of victims of historical injustice may feel insecure if a framework of justice  allows the successors of the perpetrators to benefit from the injustice on principled  grounds. This suggests they are adopting a present-oriented framework of justice. While  this framework may condemn wrongs done now to members of historically victimized  groups, it does not adequately discourage such victimization. It may make it too easy for  one group to gain advantage, without any penalty or consideration of a penalty. For  example, if a temple of a minority group was recently destroyed by a mob, it is hard for  the minority to believe that the majority regrets this earlier violence when they erect a  temple of the majority’s faith in its place.    Context Shifts and the Scope of a Framework of Justice   In the discussion so far, I have assumed that the framework of justice we adopt  now would have applied to past contexts where the dead were victimized. If one endorses  a framework in the present context, one endorses that framework for past contexts, and  52  Thomas Pogge, ""Cohen to the Rescue!,"" Ratio, 21 (2008), 454-75.     25 one could be judged for what that framework would have counted as wrong and what it  would have encouraged in past contexts where those now dead were victimized. I  mentioned earlier the possibility that a framework of justice might instead be presented as  a theory of justice relevant only for a limited range of contexts. Below I try to show why  concerns about disrespecting the dead still apply, though in a different way.   Different relational contexts might have different demands. If you and I live in a  context of shared citizenship, then I may owe you thick duties of distributive justice. If  the context is international, some theorists believe the duties are less thick and that  different parties might relate to each other as peoples.53 Different types of relational  contexts may require different frameworks of justice, which in turn require stronger or  weaker duties towards different parties.   Suppose that an indigenous people has been brought into the orbit of the state  through injustice. There is a danger in affirming a belief that they are now in the context  of a unified state, where the only important relationship is shared citizenship, and that all  claims of justice should be made on this assumption. By saying this belief is valid, we  may create an incentive for actors to create “facts on the ground” in the form of creating  new relational contexts, in the hopes that a new, more advantageous framework of justice  will apply. Suppose it is believed that the taking of land through eminent domain for  “public purposes” (such as building an oil pipeline) is only possible within the context of     53  Compare Rawls’ theory of domestic justice to his theory of international justice. See  John Rawls, The Law of Peoples (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1999).     26 shared state. Then someone who wants to build a pipeline may have an incentive to make  those who own the land part of the same state.54   Which framework matters when determining whether reparative claims persist  today? By according validity to certain beliefs about this, we may disrespect the dead. If  the state does not grapple with the possibility of context and framework shifts, then it  cannot claim that it has principles for dealing with transitions between contexts and  frameworks. It must admit that its theory of justice is incomplete. Perhaps a theory of  justice has a restricted scope and its principles do not deal directly with what happened  before the state was ""unified."" If so, then its principles can hardly claim to bar claims for  reparations stemming from wrongs done in that context.   If the state maintains that the situation where the past injustice occurred is part of  present context where the present framework is applicable, it should have a unified  framework appropriate to these contexts. There should be an account of how the  framework would have discouraged the past injustice through incentive effects, or a  justification for why it ought not have done so. If the framework would have led to  legitimate claims for reparations within that system, it should be explained why these  claims do not persist into the present.   Alternatively, if the state holds that the injustice was committed in a  fundamentally different context, where a different framework and different basic  principles hold, then there may be an incentive to switch contexts. The state must then  54  Similarly, there may be an incentive for a rich province to secede from a larger state, if  leaving a context of shared citizenship leads to weakened or non-existent duties of  distributive justice. See Allen Buchanan, Secession (Boulder: Westview Press, 1991).     27 explain how to tell when a transition to the fully domestic context occurs. It must explain  why claims from the previous context do not remain valid in the new one, or why they  only partially persist. Otherwise it cannot claim it has thought fully about why reparations  are not owed for wrongs done to the dead.    Summing Up on Incentive Effects and Reparations   It seems implausible to say that a framework of justice would insist on always  fully rectifying historical injustices. Indeed, this is not always possible. An adequate  framework of justice considers what incentive effects it would have had, if people in the  past would have known how the framework would treat reparative claims today.  Consideration of incentive effects would provide some guidelines for a framework of  justice, which would also include principles guiding decisions about reparations.   Specifically, we should consider what actions a framework would encourage (and  what sorts of meanings this communicates) if we consider it embedded in both past and  present situations. This includes consideration of incentive effects created through what  the concrete framework of justice legitimizes, not simply effects that are judged on a  strictly prospective standard. We consider how our framework looks if embedded in  different contexts, and what sort of meanings would be communicated if we allow  perverse incentives.   Below, I argue that one way to provide assurance to living descendants or  successors of victims of historical injustice is to morally reflect on and publically  articulate a framework for how to justly address claims for reparation.      28 Assurance to Contemporaries Through Moral Reflection   I discussed above how we might see certain past situations where wrong occurred  as central cases in our theories of justice. We reflect on these cases, come up with more  general principles accounting for our judgment that a wrong occurred, and apply these  more general principles to unfamiliar cases. In the course of this, we consider whether  claims for reparations may survive the death of the victim. But why engage in this  process? Why focus on cases where the dead were victimized? Here, I argue that we have  strong reasons for reflecting on certain wrongs done to past victims of historical injustice  and on whether claims of reparations endure from these wrongs. Our process of moral  theorizing can publically communicate something to present day successors of the dead  victims of historical injustice.   If we do not even consider what it would mean to make up for past wrongs (or  why this is impossible now), this can send a message about what implicit disposition the  state (or the citizenry) holds toward the successors of the dead victims. The successors of  historically oppressed victims may reasonably doubt they will be treated fairly by the  state if the state does not provide assurance that it repudiates the past. Theories  emphasizing publicity, like Rawls’, are concerned that all know that everyone follows the  principles of justice.55 Thomas Pogge is likewise concerned not only with the provision  of the objects of human rights, but also with providing secure access to those objects.56  Such assurance - that current officials and citizens are committed to following the  principles of justice - may vary in specific implementation depending on past injustice. A  55  John Rawls, Political Liberalism (New York: Columbia University Press, 2005), 181. 56  Pogge, World Poverty and Human Rights, ch. 2.     29 state authority claims to speak in the name of its citizens, so it should articulate a public  framework of justice that assures present-day citizens that it adequately condemns past  injustice.   The living should publicly articulate the reasons why the wrongs suffered by the  dead should count as wrong; this should lead them to publicly articulate whether  reparations are owed to the living and the reasons behind this view. Assurance involves  not only having such a view, but also publicly demonstrating and communicating it. Talk  can be cheap since it can allow one to mouth the words “I am sorry,” without articulating  all the reasons why the wrong should be counted as wrong. The living may need to assure  the living successors of dead victims that the reasons for not giving reparations do not  rely simply on a lack of adherence to principles.   One way to assure commitment going forward is to consider whether there are  still claims from the past that should be honored now. There should be assurance that  citizens do not adhere to a framework of justice that implies an injustice did not happen  in the past, or one that would have encouraged such an injustice. This assurance cannot  happen unless such a framework of justice is articulated into a system of (principles for)  concrete rights and duties. If the articulated system is inconsistent with publicly  remembering some atrocities as injustices, then this communicates the opposite of  assurance.   Our grounds for denying reparations may contradict the reasons for condemning  the past wrong. Consider how a theory of justice might, for example, deny reparations  using a theory of equality of resources. Not articulating the reasons for condemning the  past wrong may obscure this. A Native American nation might be denied the return of a      30 large amount of sacred land on the basis that it would make them ‘resource rich,’ even if  they would not develop the land. However, such a theory might have justified the initial  taking of the resource-rich undeveloped land.   In articulating a framework, citizens should reflect on how long reparative duties  persist. This involves being able to count the past wrong as a wrong, and not articulating  principles that in fact justify or turn a blind eye towards what happened to dead victims.  It also involves incorporating into the articulated framework concern for not incentivizing  the wrongs done to past victims. If one articulates the grounds for why a past injustice  was wrong, and why reparative duties might persist today, then the result may be a  system of justice that recognizes concrete reparative duties. We morally reflect on how  the dead were wronged in order to assure the living. This reflection may ultimately justify  reparations.   In an early work, Rawls prefers to restrict the cases judged and reflected upon to  cases likely to occur today, in part because one is likely to be familiar with these cases  and able to judge well.57 His argument suggests we should not be concerned about certain  historical cases. However, if adequately remembering past injustices requires us to  become familiar with these cases, this worry subsides. I reject a “practical action” meta-  principle that insists that theorizing about justice should be restricted only to contexts we  can now affect directly through practical action.   I instead hold we should test the adequacy of our framework of justice by  examining what it would say if it were applied in past contexts where the dead were  57  John Rawls, ""Outline of a Decision Procedure for Ethics,"" in Collected Papers, ed.  Samuel Freeman (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1999), 1-19 at 5.     31 victimized. We can still display disrespect towards those now dead, those who lived in  these historical contexts, if we never see the need to reflect on that context. The dead  cannot now be guided by principles of practical action, since they cannot act.   But if our framework of justice is thought relevant to a past context, we can  imagine how it would have guided practical action then, had the dead known about it. So  there is a connection to the idea of guiding practical action, even if those circumstances  cannot reoccur now. Our framework of justice today cannot change how the dead were  treated in the past, but we can, through imagined practical guidance, signal what  treatment would have been better. We can avoid disrespect toward the dead by sending  the message that our framework would have discouraged such victimization of the dead.  We ought to consider what signals of respect and disrespect our framework of justice  would have sent, had it been publicized to the dead while they were living. We ought to  consider what signals we send to the living by the respect or disrespect we thereby  display towards the dead.   We can also make it more difficult for the dead perpetrators of injustice to provide  to their living successors benefits stemming from unjust context shifts. Consider the  question of how a state is to treat the descendants (or successors) of dead victims who  were non-citizens when they suffered wrong. States often claim that indigenous peoples  are now fully incorporated into the state. This is belief about when shifts between  frameworks or contexts of justice occur. But what if such incorporation only occurs  through an unjust context shift that wronged the dead? Today, it might be believed that  past injustice has unfortunately resulted in the indigenous and non-indigenous existing in  a relational context of shared citizenship, which is often thought to increase the strength      32 of duties one owes to others. According to many liberal theories of justice, states are  obligated not only to protect negative rights, but to provide some positive rights to  citizens. Citizens are obligated to protect and pay the costs of other citizens’ rights and  claims of justice in a way that non-citizens are not. This is not to say that the only claims  of justice are domestic, but only that many theorists hold that duties are typically stronger  in that context. Some theories say that indigenous peoples do not have strong duties of  distributive justice outside the state; it is only within the state that their undeveloped land  counts as wealth.58 If indigenous peoples are held to only have such duties within the  state, then there is an incentive for colonizers to shift the relational context, bringing them  within the orbit of the state. This might be done through injustice, and there may be an  incentive to do so if our framework rewards such injustice, by holding that a different  framework should now resolve these claims. If we allow this transition to take place too  easily, then our view of justice disrespects the dead through perverse “incentives for the  dead.”   We could make it so our framework of justice would not provide great incentives  for such an action. For example, indigenous peoples could have an ‘opt-out,’ so that their  unexploited resources need not count as a form of wealth, as some theories of egalitarian  justice hold would be the case for citizens generally. Indigenous peoples would not be  58  Dworkin holds that equal respect through strong egalitarian justice is the virtue of  sovereigns, implying this holds only within a state; he further measures equality in a way  that counts unused resources as wealth. See Ronald Dworkin, Sovereign Virtue   (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000); Law's Empire (Cambridge, Mass.:  Belknap Press, 1986).     33 obliged to provide (at least not to the same extent) the resources used to protect the  positive rights of others. Rather than focusing on present disadvantage without regard to  the past history of someone or some group came into the orbit of a state, the state would  determine what constitutes fair treatment in part through factoring in the need to  discourage unjust actions or unjust context shifts. The state should be concerned not just  with incentives for the living but also with “incentives for the dead.”   One reason for being concerned with “incentives for the dead” is that the living  has an interest in this being the case. Today’s living are tomorrow’s dead. If we reject a  concern for creating perverse “incentives for the dead,” then the interests and status of  tomorrow’s dead could be ignored in the future. What happened to dead victims in a past  context could be ignored or slighted. So this interest means we have a present interest in  upholding the validity of the belief that incentives for the dead do count, and that the  dead should not be disrespected. The only way to do this is through a “law” or norm that  says that “past incentives” can matter. The interest the living have going forward justifies  taking the past and the dead seriously. A society can signal acceptance of this norm, and  assure people it will follow it, by applying it retroactively before the time of it acceptance  of its norms. The society should consider seriously how to address reparative claims left  over from unjust context shifts. This may not be the only way to provide assurance, but it  sends a costly signal.   This is similar in structure to Fichte’s social contract account, where the living  have an interest in the dead being seen to have rights. However, Fichte was discussing  statutory legislation within a society. Here, the form of the argument is now broadened to  a framework of justice for a particular society or even broadened to a wider approach to      34 justice regarding how and when a transition between contexts occurs. To be sure, one  society cannot legislate for all contexts or legislate for all transitions between contexts.  But for Fichte, the only way the living could have their testaments respected after they  died was through a universal law. The state can implicitly or explicitly legislate about  reparative duties left over from past contexts where the dead were wronged by that state.  It does this through the stance adopted by its framework of justice with regard to those  wrongs.   One problem is whethe r and why a society must legislate in this way, rather than  just being permitted to legislate with an eye towards the dead. After all, Fichte thought  that considering the interests of the dead was optional for a society: Only if the living  want certain benefits do they need to legislate a belief in the validity of the wills of the  dead. So a society might see the benefit in discouraging future unjust context shifts or  otherwise discouraging unjust creation of ""facts on the ground."" But it might find the  costs more burdensome. Is there a more fundamental reason?   Our earlier analysis of Kant can help us further. Kant was concerned with a  conceptual framework, the language we must adopt if we want to talk about Right   [Recht] or justice. For Kant, if we wanted to use this framework, consistency requires we  apply it to the dead. My suggestion is that the legitimacy of upholding a society’s  framework of justice depends on according status to the dead. As with Kant’s example of  basing the status of the dead with reference to their humanity, the grounds for respecting  the dead within a certain framework also presuppose respecting the dead in some way.  This differs from Fichte’s view that there is an optional choice. However, Kant based the  status of the dead on their humanity, which does not change (and so cannot be brought to      35 bear on context shifts). Here I take up Fichte’s concern with legislating for one society,  even if the reference is to “legislating” (or demonstrating a commitment to) a framework  of justice, rather than a written system of property law. But I claim that upholding a  legitimate framework of justice for a society requires including a concern for the status of  the dead. The legitimacy of a society depends on not displaying disrespect to the dead,  and so providing public assurance to the successors of the dead victims of historical  injustice. We can also imagine the legitimacy our framework of justice would acquire in  the eyes of the dead victims, if they had known how our present framework would react  to claims of reparations today. We can imagine how the dead could be assured through a  framework of justice that attempts to discourage their victimization. Providing such  imagined assurance to the dead is a way to assure the living as well.59 In a way, this may  be an existential choice about whether or not citizens want a just society that reasons  about justice in a consistent manner.    Conclusion   When a historical injustice has occurred, we ought to publically judge it to have  been unjust. This means that we should not simply mouth the words “this was unjust,”  but should formulate or extend our principles to explain why it was unjust. At the very  least, the framework of justice we uphold should not be inconsistent with principled and  sincere condemnations of past atrocities as unjust. If our framework is silent about these  injustices, this may indicate disrespect for the status of the dead within our framework.  Alternatively, if our framework is held not to apply to past contexts, then it needs to be  59  This may not be sufficient to provide assurance.     36 explained why and when a transition from one context occurs to the next. Also subject to  moral scrutiny is the adequacy of any larger theory encompassing both contexts, and the  criteria for context transition itself. The very principles for transition are subject to  something like Rawls’s method of reflective equilibrium.   If we say, our present system of justice need only repair the past to a certain  degree or not at all, then we ought to consider the public effects of this statement.  Publicity effects should not be confined to the living. We ought to consider how such a  public announcement might have changed the incentive effects for those contemplating  certain actions in the past, had they known about it. We ought to see the dead victims of  historical injustice as part of our public audience. Incentive effects are not thought of as  confined to present and future contexts. We should also imagine what past generations  would have been encouraged to do, had they been aware of what our framework would  require now. We ought to consider the message that our framework would convey to past  victims and past perpetrators, regarding when we thought it appropriate to still give  reparations or not. We ought to consider what message living successors of these victims  will thereby receive regarding how seriously we view these past wrongs.   To assure indigenous peoples and other members of historically victimized groups  of the legitimacy of the system of justice we claim to be appropriate, we must reflect  upon certain actual past contexts where injustice occurred. We must consider what our  framework of justice would have directly justified and what injustices it would have  encouraged. If it is held that our framework of justice does not extend to the past context,  we must consider what injustices would have been encouraged by any difference in the  principles between the different contexts.      37  A public framework of justice can encourage injustice. We can announce our  tolerance for such encouragement through how our framework addresses claims for  reparations today. In addressing these claims, it is presumably a condition of the  legitimacy of democratic societies that the principles of justice involve reflection upon   (and make appropriate judgments about) cases in contexts outside the domestic sphere.  This is certainly the case when the democratic state expects the allegiance of groups like  indigenous peoples now, and wants to assure them it is guided by principles such that it  will not repeat the mistakes of the past. We ought to imagine how our framework of  justice would publically assure the dead that we take their wrongs seriously. Through  respecting the dead, we help provide an assurance necessary to legitimate the state to the  living.      38 READ PAPER"
