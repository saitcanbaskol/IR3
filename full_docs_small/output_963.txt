How would you feel if I said that in order to be TRUE gluten free, you have to give up processed dairy foods? Cheese, yogurt, milk, butter, sour cream, etc.Could feeding cattle grain be contributing to this process?Is gluten found in standard store bought milk?

There is strong potential that this would be the case in animals as well. Many people consider that dairy is an essential food in the diet for calcium and vitamin D and are hesitant to stop eating it. This is just not true. The milk industry has done a remarkable job of marketing to the general public on this. Much in the same way that the grain industry has everyone believing that they need 8-10 servings per day. Consider the following when forming a decision on this topic:Lactose in dairy is hard to digest for humans over three years of age. We go through a genetic down regulation in the production of this enzyme as a natural part of aging.The majority of dairy sold in the U.S. is genetically modified and loaded with hormones.The cows that produce the milk are not pastured, they are gluten fed.Most dairy products contain thickening agents made with grains.Products are pasteurized. This denatures proteins and damages the other immune boosting properties of milk.Fat is removed. Skim milk is toxic. Fat is not unhealthy. Unhealthy fat is. The difference is in how the animal is fed. In the case of the cow – grains are the primary staple. Fat derived from grain is highly inflammatory thus promoting and perpetuating chronic disease.Many products contain added sugar or artificial sweeteners and flavors. These chemicals are not conducive to good health.One of the main proteins in GMO dairy, casein, has been shown to contribute to autoimmune diseases of the skin including eczema and psoriasis. This same protein in strikingly similar in structure to gluten.Clinically speaking, people who go gluten free/dairy free typically have faster recovery of illness than those only going gluten free.If you would like to keep dairy in your gluten free diet remember that you should only buy from a grass fed source. Regular grocery stores typically carry products that are derived from cattle that are grain/gluten fed and contain added hormones. Remember that an organic on dairy means that the cow was fed organic grain.Grass fed dairy can be found at a local farmer’s market.
