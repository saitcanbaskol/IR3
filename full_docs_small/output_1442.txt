"The Home Spa: Steam Facialstweet email 18By: Annie B. Bond May 26, 1999About Annie B.Shut out the world for a while and breathe deeply of this relaxing and hydrating herbal steam facial. Steam opens the skin’s pores while deeply cleansing and rejuvenating all the skin’s layers. Using herbs in facial steams is a wonderful way to nourish your skin. All you need to make your own natural facial is a pot of water, a method of heating the water, and a towel. Therapeutic herbs can be infused in the water so that their healing benefits will become part of the steam and reach deep into your pores.Herbs have surprising effects on the skin. Many are emollient, softening and lubricating; others hydrate and moisturize; and most are antibacterial and anti-inflammatory. Licorice root is the number one herbal choice for steaming no matter what your skin type, because it helps open the pores, soothes, cleanses, and lubricates. Just break a piece of root into your steam pot. As for other herbs, for dry skin try lavender, mint or calendula; for sensitve skin try calendula, chamomile, or comfrey; for oily skin try mint, lavender, rose and/or witch hazel. Note: Those with asthma or allergies to herbs should speak to their doctor before using these herbs in a steam. Chamomile is in the ragweed family.If you are traveling, instead of steaming your face with herb-infused water, you can use the hot-towel method. Saturate a towel with steaming hot water. Let cool enough to touch the skin, then wrap your clean face with it, and leave it on for two minutes or so.Love This? Never Miss Another Story.Here are simple, seven-step directions to make your own facial steam:1. Place a handful of herbs in a pot of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes, adding water as needed.2. Secure your hair back from your face.3. Wash your face as usual.4. Place the pot with the steaming water on a trivet or potholder on a table or countertop. Make a tent over your head with a towel, and hang your head over the steaming pot. Make sure not to lean close enough to the steam to scald yourself.5. Keep your face in the steam tent for about 5 minutes.6. Rinse your face with cool water.7. Follow with an astringent (for example, witch hazel) to close the pores.By Annie B. Bond"
