"Simulation Hospital at the School of Nursing and Health StudiesSimulated Setting, Real-World ImpactThe UM SONHS Simulation Hospital takes education of healthcare professionals to a new level, with simulation training opportunities previously unmatched in scope and capacity. In this transformative facility, using a combination of high tech mannequins, standardized patients, and actors, students will be challenged to respond to an individual who walks into the six-bed emergency department with, for example, neck pain, and while that patient is undergoing standard diagnostic procedures, a “trauma victim” who arrives in the ambulance bay is evaluated and rushed upstairs to one of the third floor’s four operating room suites for lifesaving surgery. Meanwhile, an “expectant mother” arrives and is admitted to the third floor labor and delivery suite; her “newborn infant” will be admitted to the nearby neonatal intensive care unit or newborn nursery, depending on its health status. Meanwhile, a combination of medical-surgical hospital rooms and an apartment (homecare) setting facilitate valuable lessons in palliative and hospice care."
