There are lots of ""Shuffe Competitions"" that are held..either in a big stadium..or on a street..usually in the city centre's. This video is really good..it explains the basic's of shuffling and shows you step by step how to do them..and he explains why as well. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdbRu_Q_8... The main shuffle in Australia is called ""The Melbourne Shuffle"" The basis of the Melbourne Shuffle has traditionally been footwork performed by combining three basic steps. Sliding to the left or right and then back and forth. When performed well, shufflers can seem to be gliding across the floor seemingly defying friction. Shuffling on Spot is used for different reasons. A Shuffler using this step can conserve energy for a few moments prior to a change in beat and pattern of music. A Shuffler may step back and allow another dancer to take centre stage meanwhile Shuffling on Spot. Arm movements come into play more often while in this step as it allows the dancer to express a connection with the music as to the beat with the feet. Shuffle in a triangular pattern is a very energetic step which can be performed with great flair. The modern shuffler usually performs around 5 different moves while shuffling: The running man is the most popular move where the shuffler ""runs"" on the spot. One foot is lifted from standing position and placed in front while the other slides back, then the foot at the back is lifted up into the standing position while the forward foot slides into the standing position and the process is repeated to the beat. This is also known as the two-step technique. The shuffle is a t-shaped movement, where the shuffler moves to the right with their left foot, shifting left and right as the right foot rises up and down, creating a T-shaped like shape. It is a common move amongst shufflers. Slides, where the shuffler normally slides left and right occasionally, the slide is usually and long ""glide"" along the dance floor and is mostly followed by a spin. Spins can be ""normal"" or ""inverted"". A normal spin meaning you lift one foot from standing position and use it to propel your body in a clockwise direction. An inverted spin is the opposite, where you lift one foot from standing position and use it to propel yourself in an anticlockwise direction. Both spins are common and are incorporated into the shuffle. Kicks are done with one foot while the other is used to ""shuffle"" along to one side. Kicks can be low (some shufflers prefer to kick at the ground while shuffling to one side) and high (some shufflers kicking up to their waists). The point of kicking is to look balanced and controlled, so when kicking multiple times shufflers prefer not to bend their knees while their leg is in the air. Jumps are used in the sequnce of shuffling jumps are usually used in accordance with spins. Spin jumps are quite popular amongst shufflers. Dance moves from other styles such as mimeing, popping, locking, liquiding, running man and breaking can also be incorporated into shuffling.
