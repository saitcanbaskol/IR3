Arteries are the blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to every organ in the body. In healthy individuals, arteries are clear, and blood can flow smoothly, but occasionally over time, they may develop a buildup of fatty deposits or plaque, commonly known as hardened or clogged arteries.Blame It on the Bad FatThe medical term for clogged arteries is atherosclerosis, and it’s a major risk factor for heart attack or stroke, because clogged and hardened arteries may restrict blood flow to some parts of the brain or heart. Sometimes the plaque buildup is hereditary, but often, it’s related to diet. Eating too many foods that are high in saturated or trans (bad) fats can raise cholesterol levels, and excess cholesterol gets deposited in the arteries, causing atherosclerosis. Foods that have lots of cholesterol but are low in fat, like eggs, usually have a minimal impact on cholesterol levels for most people. Still, people with heart disease or diabetes should watch their dietary cholesterol intake.Where to Find Sat FatSaturated fats are usually solid at at room temperature and occur mostly in animal-based foods, like high-fat meats and dairy products. Meats with the most saturated fat include steak, hamburger, bacon, sausages, ribs, chicken or turkey skin and many deli meats. Lean meats like skinless turkey or chicken, fish or most cuts of pork are lower in fat and healthier alternatives.Creamy, rich dairy products like cream, whole milk, cheese, ice cream and butter might taste good, but they’re also very high in saturated fat. Switch to 1 percent or nonfat milk or yogurt and lowfat cheese to eliminate or reduce saturated fat. Don’t forget to keep an eye on foods like chowders, pizza or Mexican dishes loaded with real cream and cheese.In general, cooking oils are unsaturated and fairly heart healthy, with a few exceptions. Coconut, palm kernel and palm oils are plant-based oils that are very saturated and often used in cooking or baked products. Use liquid oils like olive or canola instead.Steer Clear of Trans Fat, TooTrans fat, also known as partially hydrogenated oil, is formed when hydrogen is added to liquid oil to make it solid. Food manufacturers favor it because it’s inexpensive and lasts a long time. Fortunately, its use is declining, thanks to new legislation that bans the use of trans fats in food. The rule won't be fully implemented until 2018, though, which means you'll need to scan the label in the meantime.Be a Label ReaderThe best way to identify any packaged foods with saturated or trans fat is to check the food label. Choose foods that have zero grams of trans fat and no partially hydrogenated oil in the ingredients list. Keep saturated fat grams as low as possible. The American Heart Association recommends limiting saturated fat to less than 7 percent of calories (about 16 grams a day, if you eat a 2,000-calorie diet) and trans fats from packaged foods to zero to reduce your risk of atherosclerosis.References  (3)Cleveland Clinic: Heart FactsHarvard School of Public Health –- The Nutrition Source: Fats and Cholesterol – Out With The Bad, In With the GoodAmerican Heart Association: Trans Fats Q&AResources  (1)American Heart Association: Meet the FatsAbout the AuthorAnne Danahy is a Boston-based RD/nutritionist who counsels individuals and groups, and writes about healthy eating for wellness and disease management.
