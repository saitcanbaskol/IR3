Afterwards, uninstall Match! ,  then make sure to manually remove all Match! program directories that might still exist. You are now ready to download and run the corresponding new version installer from the links below.  Once you have installed the new version, please move your license file ""yourlicense.lic"" from the temporary directory  back into the new Match! program directory.

These data come from the COD  (""Crystallography Open Database"") .There are three different COD reference database packages available:  The complete COD reference pattern database containing all appropriate entries from the COD,  another package containing only COD reference patterns for inorganic compounds  (without C-H-bonds),  and finally a tiny small reference database that contains only reference patterns for Cement phases.The COD Inorganics reference pattern database (which can be downloaded below) can be used with Match! version 1.7 or higher. Please note,  however, that the full COD reference database (containing more than 387,000 entries) can only be used with Match! version 3  64-bit versions, because the central database file has become so large (> 2 GB) that it can no longer be accessed  with earlier as well as 32-bit versions. The  most recent full COD version that is still compatible with Match! version 1 has been released on January 4, 2016, and  can be downloaded from here.Installation instructions: First of all, download the compressed reference database file (s), by clicking on the  corresponding file name (link) in the table below. When the download has finished, please unzip the contents of the zip-file (s) to the directory  where you would like to save/create the new reference database.Once you have extracted the contents of the zip-file (s) please run Match!, open the Reference Database Library (e.g. from the ""Tools"" menu),  press the ""Add"" button, and select the file ""MatchRefDBInfo.mtn"" in the directory where you have unzipped the files.

Follow the instructions on the screen, paying attention not to use directory  names with blank or non ASCII characters in their name.Mac OS X FullProf4Mac.app is the full implementation of the FULLPROF suite (64 bits). It is signed with the “Institut Laue-Langevin” certificate.         OpenMotif is embedded and there is no need for defining any environment variable.         Just double-click the icon of the application to launch it.Requirements:macOS Mountain Lion (10.8) or higherthe free X11 tool XQuartz.app (at http://xquartz.macosforge.org) version 2.7.9 or higher must be present on your computer.Installation         Download the file ""FullProf4Mac-vxxx.dmg"" to the Desktop. Click on it and drag the FullProf4Mac icon to the icon ""Applications"". That's all !Linux Download the installer file from the table above. Afterwards, please perform the following steps:General Mode (for all the users of the system)Activate the super-user modeCreate a directory in which you want to hold the programs of the FullProf_Suite.  For instance: /usr/local/bin/FullProf_Suite in some Linux systemsCopy the file FullProf_Suite_XXXXNNNN_Lin.tgz (XXX=Month NNNN=year) in the  directory just created in step 2.Decompress the file .tgz with the following command:tar -xzvf FullProf_Suite_XXXXNNNN_Lin.tgzTell the users to activate the environment variable FULLPROF in their configuration file (see below)Local Mode (Installation for a single user)Create a directory in which you want to hold the programs of the FullProf_Suite,  e.g. $HOME/FullProf_SuiteFor doing that you must execute the following commands:cd $HOME  mkdir FullProf_Suite  cd FullProf_SuiteCopy the file FullProf_Suite_XXXXNNNN_Lin.tgz (XXXX=Month NNNN=year) in the  directory just created in step 2Decompress the file .tgz with the following command:tar -xzvf FullProf_Suite_XXXXNNNN_Lin.tgzModify the configuration file to activate the environment variable FULLPROF (see below)Activation of the environment variable of the FullProf_SuiteDepending of the SHELL of the user the commands are different. The aim is to create the  environment variable FULLPROF. To know what is the shell one is using you should execute the command:echo $SHELLGenerally it is one of the following: Bourne (sh, bash), Korn (ksh), C (csh)From now we suppose we are using the Bourne of bash type. If you have another one you must  consult how to do the equivalent commands we explain below.Edit the setting file of the user. In our case it should be in the root directory of  the user and the name is .bashrc or .bash_profileAdd the environment variable FULLPROF, that has as value the absolute path of the directory  in which we have installed the programs of the FullProf Suite. For instance:FULLPROF=/opt/FullProf_Suite  FULLPROF=/usr/local/bin/FullProf_Suite<Add the above directory to the PATH variablePATH=$FULLPROF:$PATHExport the defined variableexport FULLPROFThe changes will be effective on opening a new terminal window. To verify that everything is OK,  just type in your terminal the command:echo $FULLPROFThe system will show the directory in which you have installed the programs.After performing all the above steps all the programs of the FullProf Suite are available from whatever  working directory. If you need to update the FullProf Suite you just have to do the steps 3 and 4 of the  General or Local mode described above. Only in the case you decide to use another directory you have to  redefine the environment variable. You can use the programs in console mode or use the toolbar (command  tfp) to access the different programs.Depending of your installation you may need to install the libraries of OpenMotif version 2.3.  Do that only in case one of the GUIs doesn't work and you see a message of the form: ""libXm.so.3"" not available  or something similar."
