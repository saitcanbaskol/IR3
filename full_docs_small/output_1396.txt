" (Image credit: Rachel Joy Baransi)Buying a whole ham for Easter, Christmas, or a special occasion is one of the easiest ways to serve an entree for a large crowd. Even though the ham is already pre-cooked, you can still brush it with a homemade glaze as you're heating it up to add some sweetness and punch.Here are five easy glazes you can throw together from mostly store-bought condiments to make the ham your own!Easy 3-Ingredient Glazes for HamEach recipe will make about two cups of glaze, which is enough to glaze an eight- to 10-pound ham. Make sure the glaze cools to room temperature before you use it, as it will thicken as it cools. All of these glazes can be made up to five days in advance and stored in the refrigerator.To use these glazes, brush them on several times near the end of the ham's baking time.

Bourbon, Molasses, and Clove GlazeThis deeply flavored combination of sticky molasses, ground cloves, and a hefty dose of fiery bourbon is a great pairing with the sweet-salty flavors of ham.Whisk 1 1/3 cups molasses  (not blackstrap), 2/3 cup bourbon, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves together in a medium saucepan over medium heat and bring to a full boil. Continue to cook at a lively simmer for three to five minutes, until thickened slightly. Let cool to room temperature.2. Pineapple, Apricot, and Ginger GlazeInstead of laying pineapple rings on the ham, blend the fruit with apricot preserves and fresh ginger for a slightly tropical kick that has some spicy heat from the ginger.Combine 1 cup crushed pineapple in pineapple juice, 1 cup apricot preserves, and 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger in a medium saucepan over medium heat and bring to a full boil. Transfer to a blender and blend until smooth. Season to taste with salt and let cool to room temperature.3. Brown Sugar, Soy, and Garlic GlazeTeriyaki sauce isn't just for beef or chicken â€” try this simple version brushed over ham for a more spicy kick!Whisk 1 1/3 cups packed light brown sugar, 2/3 cup soy sauce, and 2 minced garlic cloves together in a medium saucepan over medium heat and bring to a full boil. Continue to cook at a lively simmer for three to five minutes, until thickened slightly. Let cool to room temperature.4. Orange and Honey-Mustard GlazeWhile honey and mustard are standard accompaniments to ham, adding orange juice and orange zest to the mix gives the glaze a nice hit of citrus flavor, too.Whisk 1 1/3 cups orange juice  (plus the finely grated zest of the oranges; if you squeeze the juice yourself, you'll need about 4 oranges), 1/2 cup whole-grain mustard, and 1/4 cup honey together in a medium saucepan over medium heat and bring to a full boil. Continue to cook at a lively simmer for three to five minutes, until thickened slightly. Let cool to room temperature.5. Peach, Chipotle, and Cider Vinegar GlazeThis twist on pepper jelly uses peach preserves, spicy chipotles in adobo sauce for smoky heat, and some cider vinegar to round everything out. Don't forget a good dose of salt to balance everything out.Whisk 1 1/3 cups peach preserves, 2/3 cup cider vinegar, 1 tablespoon minced chipotles in adobo sauce, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt together in a medium saucepan over medium heat and bring to a full boil. Continue to cook at a lively simmer for five minutes, until thickened slightly. If the mixture contains large chunks of peach, transfer to a blender and blend until smooth.
