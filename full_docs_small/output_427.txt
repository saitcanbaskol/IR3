(: lolSep 21, 2012Upvote - 0MrsC2008I was convinced i was having a girl because the heartrate is always around 165- 70 but turns out iam having boy so iam not sure the old wives tale is accurate :-)Sep 21, 2012Upvote - 0KTowneI'm having a girl and her H/B is pretty low, hers is about 130-140 resting, and 150's when active.Sep 21, 2012Upvote - 0mrsreeder2beDon't believe the heartbeat thing. One of my boys had a high heart rate, while my other boy had a low heart rate. My lil girl also had a low heart rate.Sep 21, 2012Upvote - 0ChatybabyMy daughter has been about 159... I dont believe in the heart rate thing because it all has to do with how active they have been or if they are restingSep 21, 2012Upvote - 0dancerz82I'm having a girl and her heart beat was always at the lower end of the scale. Each child is different nothing to do with gender!Sep 21, 2012Upvote - 0MinkY001125Its not an accurate indicator. My doctor said at least.Sep 21, 2012Upvote - 0Your AnswerNotify me of new activity on this questionJoin this communityAnswerPrevious Question Next Question"
