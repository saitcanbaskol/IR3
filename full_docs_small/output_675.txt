This Aolters the chemical composition of a rock What is partial melting? Explain how partial melting affects igneous rock formationGranitic: light-colored rock that has high silica content Basaltic: dark-colored, has low silica content what are the two main groups of igneous rocks? What are the characteristics of each group?They would have more room to expand why would crystals formed. early in magma crystallization have larger, better-shaped crystals than those that formed latercrystals that cooled faster had larger crystals because the had more room to fill in so then the later crystals had smaller spaces to form and cool what sequence of events produces porphyritic texture in rocks?True True of false;. Different minerals Melt and Crystallize at different temperaturesTrue Igneous rockscanke identified by their physical properties of crystal size and texturefalse; often Igneous rocks ane rarely used as building materials because of their Strength durability, and beautyTrue Diamond's are sometimes found in igneous intrusions known as kimberlitesigneous intrusions Valuable ore deposit's and gem crystals ane often associated withpressure and water content factors that affect a rock's melting point includefinely grained Exrusuve rocks which cool more rapidly than intrusive rocks, are generally moreextrusive Igneous rocks that cool quickly on earth's surface aneintrusive I.yneousrscks that cool slowly beneath Earth's crust arecrystallizes Igneous rocks are formed when magmaFlickr Creative Commons ImagesSome images used in this set are licensed under the Creative Commons through Flickr.com.
