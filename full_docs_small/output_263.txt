"DECIDOUS TREESTHE TALLEST LAYER in the D eciduous Forest IS 100 FEET HIGH WITH LARGE OAK ,MAPLE, BEECH, CHESTNUT,HICKORY, ELM, BASSWOOD, LINDEN, WALNUT,AND SWEET GUM TREES.SHRUB LAYERSHRUBS LIKE RHODOENDRONS, AZALEAS,MOUNTAIN LAURELS,AND HUCKLE BERRIES live in the Deciduous Forest..soilthe soil in the deciduous forest is quite fertile since it is often enriched with falling leaves, twigs, logs, and dead organisms.fall colors!In the fall the number of hours of daylight decreases which causes some plants and trees (called deciduous) to stop producing chlorophyll, a green pigment that converts sunlight into chemical energy and eventually they will lose their leaves. During this time these leaves turn to bright colors ranging from red to orange to yellow to brown.herb layerThe Herb layers are basically short plants. ""Deciduous"" means to fall off, or shed, seasonally. Just as the name implies, these deciduous trees shed their leaves each fall. Lying on the forest floor, the leaves decay. As the leaves decompose, the nutrients contained in the leaves are absorbed by the soil. For this reason, the soils of this biome tend to be very fertile. Because this biome has fertile soil and a long, 5 to 6 month, growing season, many deciduous forests have been converted into agricultural regions.ground layerLynches club mosses and true mosses.Ground Layer - You can find lichens and mossesHerb Layer - You can find short plantsShrub Layer - You can find shrubs, such as azaleas and mountain laurelsSmall Tree or Sapling Layer - You can find short and young treesTree Layer or Stratum - Tallest layer, is 60 to 100 feet high. You can find large oak trees, maple trees, and chestnut trees.locationDeciduous forests can be found in the eastern half of North America, and the middle of Europe. There are many Deciduous Forests in Asia. Some of the major areas that they are in are southwest Russia, Japan, and eastern China. South America has two big areas of Deciduous Forests in southern Chile and Middle East coast of Paraguay. There are Deciduous Forests also located in New Zealand, and southeastern Australia also.how animals adaptThe animals adapt to the climate by hibernating in the winter and living off the land in the other three seasons. The animals have adapted to the land by trying the plants in the forest to see if they are good to eat for a good supply of food. Also the trees provide shelter for them. Animal use the trees for food and a water sources. Most of the animals are camouflaged to look like the ground.seasonsThe Deciduous Forest has four distinct seasons, spring, summer, Fall, and winter. In the Fall the leaves change color. During the winter months the trees lose their leaves.food webThis is a forest of angiosperms. You will find fruit trees and berry bushes growing wild here, along with insects to pollinate them. Although these forests may go through mixed stands with conifers, the conifers gradually disappear as changes in rainfall and climate favor Deciduous trees."
