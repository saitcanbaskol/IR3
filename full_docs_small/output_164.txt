It is expressed by the equation V = W/q where W is the energy in Joules and q is the charge in coulombs. In a 1.5 volt energy cell each coulomb of charge has 1.5 Joules of energy; in a 12 volt battery each coulomb of charge has 12 Joules of energy. Interestingly, voltage exists even when there is no current (the charge is not moving). A 1.5 v cell or 12 v battery has voltage even when it is sitting unused in its package. it is measured by connecting up a circuit. to get more information high schoolers, look in the CXC integrated science and turn to page 174 and read to get a proper understanding. i trust that this will help. reading is a good exercise to the brain.11 people found this usefulWas this answer useful?YesSomewhatNoMuhammad Muddasir 6 ContributionsHow do you measure voltage?Voltage can be measured using the difference between the potentiel between two ends of wire or by using a volt-meter.
