"Pets DogsHow long after vaccinations can our puppy go out?Our puppy is having his vaccinations at 8 and 10 weeks, how long after this will he be able to go out?Update: I'm not sure where everyone else is located, but I understood that this was the normal schedule of vaccinations? I've spoken to quite a lot of vets and they all seem to advise the same thing?Follow 14 answersAnswersRelevanceRatingNewestOldestBest Answer: 8weeks and 10 weeks is right in UK people who say different are probably from the states so there vaccinations are different from ares. After his second vaccinaton you need to wait a week. I would also advice get him done for kennel cough which are drops up their nose.poodle power · 9 years ago0 0 CommentAsker's ratingShould be fine after 2 weeks, though your vet will tell you the exact time. If you're able to, take him to a puppy class for socialising, your vets can advice you on where, they may even do it themselves. If you can carry lift your pup take him out to get used to smells/cars/everything really, trip in the car, just don't let him mix with dogs you don't know or in areas that strange dogs go. Try and find healthy dogs that you know have been vaccinated to socialise with in the garden. Ukredrosie · 9 years ago0 0 CommentI live in the UK, my vet did my Lab pup's jabs at 8 and 12 weeks. He then said wait another 7 days before you go out on walks. Our local pet shop owner, who has a Golden Retriever, said her vet made her wait 14 days after the second injection.sonofvi · 9 years ago1 0 CommentMy dog has just finished his vaccinations and the vet told me a week before I was allowed to take him out of his own garden. He has been out and met my families dogs and he is doing very well.kittiebann · 9 years ago0 0 Commentyour puppy will also need vaccines at 12 and 15 weeks. wait at least 2 weeks after the last set before allowing puppy to have contact with other dogs. the moms immunity wears off around 12 weeks, so any vaccines given before then will not provide your pup with immunity (assuming mom had immunity to pass on), that is the reason for the 2 rounds after the 12 week mark.bob © · 9 years ago0 2 CommentThat is too close together. They should be given no closer than three weeks to each other nor longer than 4 weeks apart. 8, 12 & 16 weeks is a good schedule as it makes the last shot at 16 weeks and then it will be the last one. The last shot in the puppy series needs to be given after the pups are 16 weeks or older. Then wait a month for the rabies shot. If there has been no disease in your yard like Parvo or distemper, your pup can go in your yard but do not take it out in public for 1 week after the second shot at the soonest. I usually wait until 1 week after the third shot.Source (s):UC Davis vet school recommendationsPat A · 9 years ago2 4 CommentDog training techniques are controversial. But, which dog training techniques can you trust? Learn here http://OnlineDogTraining.enle.info/?EYbU The discussion about which dog training technique to use when training a dog is one that resembles a discussion between an Israeli and a Palestinian. Each one seems absolutely certain of their position and is more than ready to vilify those who don't share their views on dog training. But, if you look at dog training techniques and methods and evaluate their worth and effectiveness based on whether the approach is balanced, it's a lot easier to weed out the garbage. For the most part, trainers and their methods fall into two main categories. Those who do not use a physical consequence as a deterrent and those who do. There are many variations in the methods used by different trainers however, almost all trainers fall into one category or the other. Some trainers use food as a reward and never allow the dog to experience a negative consequence for a poor choice. Other trainers afford the dog the opportunity to experience a consequence for making poor choices. The Use Of Food: Using food is great in the sense that you will probably have a very happy dog on your hands when he realizes that the training comes with an all-you-can-eat buffet. However, using food to train your dog has some pitfalls we think you should be aware of. Food is great if you just want to impress your guests with a couple silly pet tricks but, in the real world, your dog will probably be much more interested in chasing the cat than hanging around to get your silly, dry biscuit. So, if you are using food as the primary or sole motivator, you're in for some disappointment when it comes time for your dog to perform in the real world. Strictly Positive Reinforcement: It is not difficult to find trainers who will tell you they use a kinder, gentler method than those used by consequence and reward trainers. They will tell you that your dog will be emotionally destroyed by the use of correction as a deterrent. Their goal is to sell you on their loving approach to dog training. They would have you believe that their method is much better than those old, barbaric correction methods. If you try to train your dog with a method of training that is as imbalanced as this, you will be in for some serious disappointments. Sure, it sounds like a great idea; training your dog and never having to correct him for making a poor choice. Never having to do the very thing you like doing the least. However, no matter how distasteful the concept of physical consequence is to you, it is necessary if you want a really good dog. You cannot consistently praise a dog when he does something right and never give him a consequence for doing something wrong, and expect him to turn out balanced. Consequence And Reward: In some cases, dog training methods that involve physical consequence as a deterrent cause additional problems. Not by virtue of the fact that the dog received a physical consequence for his poor choice, but because the training was too harsh, improper, or the balance between consequence and reward was not achieved. A bad trainer can destroy any good training system. It is far from true that methods using consequence as a deterrent will result in a fearful dog. It all depends on the skill of the trainer, the manner in which the dog is corrected and the balance between consequence and reward. Dog training techniques and methods that use a healthy balance between consequence and reward are without doubt, the most effective, healthy training techniques you can use. It is important to remember that consequence in NEVER connected to emotion while reward is always given with sincerity and love.? · 1 year ago0 0 Commenta pair of week, yet your vet could be attentive to there's a bad trojan horse around on your section. hear to his suggestion. it incredibly is in basic terms a pair of weeks interior the whole existence of your new puppy after all. and in certainty, maximum domestic canines should not be dragged around everywhere in the start line with. they might desire to be progressively geared up up (muscle groups, joints) so in fact, your vet could be doing you a favour via recommending you are not getting your puppy out in simple terms yet.conte · 2 years ago0 0 Comment12 weeks would be fine.
