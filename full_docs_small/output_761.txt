"Membrane StructureThis activity contains 5 questions.Which major biological molecules make up the plasma membrane?carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acidsproteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acidscarbohydrates, proteins, and lipidscarbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acidslipids, proteins, and nucleic acidsWhich statement is true about the phospholipid bilayer?The hydrophobic tails face each other in the center of the bilayer.The hydrophobic heads face each other in the center of the bilayer.The hydrophilic heads face each other in the center of the bilayer.The hydrophilic tails face each other in the center of the bilayer.The layers of the bilayer are stacked head to tail to head to tail.Saying that the plasma membrane is a fluid mosaic means ________.numerous ""pieces"" are immersed in waterThe glycoproteins appear to have random but fixed positions in the bilayer.The glycoproteins appear to be randomly placed (as in a mosaic) and have a degree of freedom to move about the bilayer. (Fluid means movement.)The location of the cholesterol molecules cannot be determined.The glycoproteins move randomly as long as they are immersed in water.True or False. Regarding the proteins and cholesterol in the animal plasma membrane, some proteins are embedded in the bilayer, other proteins are only on one side, and the cholesterol is scattered throughout the inner parts of the membrane.truefalseWhich statement about the relationship between carbohydrates and the plasma membrane is true?Carbohydrates are generally attached to the lipid portion of the plasma membrane.Most carbohydrates are attached to proteins in the membrane and thus form glycoproteins.Most carbohydrates are attached to the inner surface of the plasma membrane.Carbohydrates are usually free particles within the fluid mosaic.All of the above answers are incorrect.Answer choices in this exercise appear in a different order each time the page is loaded.Copyright Â© 1995 - 2017 Pearson Education .
