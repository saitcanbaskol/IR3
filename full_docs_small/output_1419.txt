Theinteraction of antibody with antigen also activates the complement system. Compare cellular immunity.

B lymphocytes with receptors to a specific antigenreact when they encounter that antigen by producing plasma cells  (which produce antigen-specific antibodies) and memory cells  (whichenable the body to produce these antibodiesquickly in the event that the same antigenappears later). B-cell differentiation also is stimulated by interleukin-2  (IL-2) secreted by CD4+ T cells and foreign antigens processed by macrophages.Antibodies produced by plasma B cells, foundmainly in the blood, spleen, and lymph nodes,neutralize or destroy antigens in several ways.They kill organisms by activating thecomplement system; neutralize viruses andtoxins released by bacteria; coat the antigen (opsonization) or form an antigen-antibodycomplex to stimulate phagocytosis; promoteantigen clumping  (agglutination); and prevent theantigen from adhering to host cells.Synonym: B-cell–mediated immunity See: illustration; cell-mediated immunity; immunoglobulinSee also: immunityMedical Dictionary, © 2009 Farlex and Partnershumoral immunity,n a defense system of the immune system, including antibodies and sensitized white cellsthat are produced to fight specific pathogens.Jonas: Mosby's Dictionary of Complementary and Alternative Medicine.

See humoral immunity.immunity1. the condition of being immune; security against a particular disease; nonsusceptibility to the invasive or pathogenic effects of microorganisms or helminth parasites or to the toxiceffect of antigenic substances. Called also functional or protective immunity.2. responsiveness to antigen that leads to more rapid binding or elimination of antigen than in the nonimmune state; it includes both humoral and cell-mediated immunity  (below).3. the capacity to distinguish foreign material from self, and to neutralize, eliminate or metabolize that which is foreign  ( non-self) by the physiological mechanisms of the immuneresponse.The mechanisms of immunity are essentially concerned with the body's ability to recognizeand dispose of substances which it interprets as foreign and sometimes harmful to its well-being. When such a substance enters the body, complex chemical and mechanical activitiesare set into motion to defend and protect the body's cells and tissues. The foreign substance,usually a protein, is called an antigen, that is, one which generates the production of an antagonist. The most readily recognized response to the antigen is the production of antibody. The antigen-antibody reaction is an essential component of the overall immuneresponse. Of equal or greater importance to antibody, particularly for some antigens, is thedevelopment of so-called cell-mediated immune response, which involves clonal expansion of specifically reactive T lymphocytes including cytotoxic T lymphocytes  (T c lymphocytes)which play a major role in eliminating the foreign antigens that are cell associated.Immunological responses in animals can be divided into two broad categories: humoralimmunity, which refers to the production of antibody which becomes part of the body fluids (humors), especially serum, and cell-mediated or cellular immunity, which involves a variety of activities designed to destroy or at least contain cells that are recognized by the body as expressing foreign antigens on their cell surface, e.g. viral antigens. Both types of responseare mediated by lymphocytes that originate in the bone marrow as stem cells and later areconverted into mature cells having specific properties and functions.acquired immunityantigen specific immunity attributable to the production of antibody and of specific immune T lymphocytes  (responsible for cell-mediated immunity), following exposure to an antigen, or passive transfer of antibody or immune lymphoid cells  (adoptive immunity).active immunitythat which follows exposure to an antigen; acquired immunity attributable to the presence of antibody or of immune lymphoid cells formed in response to antigenic stimulus. Calledalso adaptive immunity.adoptive immunitypassive immunity of the cell-mediated type conferred by the administration of sensitizedlymphocytes from an immune donor to a naive recipient.artificial immunityincludes acquired  (active) immunity produced by deliberate exposure to an antigen, such as a vaccine or the administration of antibody  (passive).cellular immunitydependent upon T lymphocytes which are sensitized by first exposure to a specificantigen. Subsequent exposure stimulates the release of a group of substances known as lymphokines, such as interferon, and interleukins as well as direct killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes.functional immunitysee immunity  (above).humoral immunitymediated by antibodies formed by antigen-specific B lymphocytes. Each B lymphocytehas monomeric IgM receptors which capture specific antigen, initiating production of thespecific immunoglobulins. B lymphocytes activated by the presence of their specificantigen undergo transformation, lymphocyte blastogenesis, whereby they becomemetabolically active, divide, and some mature to plasma cells, which are major producers of antibodies. Some cells revert to small lymphocytes, 'memory' cells, and the expandedclone of these cells, on re-exposure to the antigen, undergo further lymphocyteblastogenesis, leading to further increased antibody production and numbers of memorycells.There are two types of humoral immune response: primary and secondary. The primaryresponse begins immediately after the inital contact with an antigen; the resultingantibody, predominantly IgM, appears 48 to 72 hours later. The secondary responseoccurs within 24 to 48 hours and produces large quantities of predominantly IgG. Thesecondary response persists much longer than the primary response and is the result of repeated contact with the antigens.innate immunity, native immunity, natural immunitynatural immunity resulting from the genetic makeup of the host, before exposure to an antigen.maternal immunitythat acquired by the neonate by transplacental transfer of immunoglobulins or fromingestion of colostrum or via the yolk sac in the case of birds. The placentation of allagricultural animals precludes trans-placental transfer of immunoglobulin. Passive transfer of maternal immunity is effected by the transfer of immunoglobulilns present in highconcentration in the first milk, colostrum, through the intestine of the newborn. Thesuccess of this transfer is dependent upon the time after birth that colostrum is ingested (physiologically 24-36 hours, but effectively for adequate transfer, 8 hours after birth) and on the mass of immunoglobulin ingested which is determined by the concentration of immunoglobulin in colostrum and the amount of colostrum ingested.Failure of passive transfer results in a significant increase in risk for neonatal disease.Neonates that fail to acquire serum concentrations of IgG 1 greater than 10 mg/ml are at significantly higher risk of septicemic, enteric and respiratory disease. Failure of passivetransfer occurs as a result of neonates sucking the dam or acquiring colostrum by artificialfeeding too late in the absorptive process, or by receiving too little colostrum or receivingcolostrum with low immunoglobulin concentration. See also passive immunity  (below) andcolostral immunoglobulin.natural immunitysee innate immunity  (above).passive immunitythe transfer of antibodies from a donor in which they were produced to a recipient fortemporary immunity. Can be in the form of serum or colostrum or yolk. Significanttransplacental transfer of antibodies is found in primates, but does not occur in domesticanimals. Passive immunity in domestic mammals comes via the colostrum, with its highconcentration of antibodies, and the more than normally pervious epithelium of theneonate's intestinal epithelium. In birds maternal antibody is transferred to the yolk, fromwhere the developing chick embryo absorbs it from about day 11 of incubation.
