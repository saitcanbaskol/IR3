"What is the Spartan Trifecta? How do I earn it?A member of the Spartan Trifecta Tribe finishes one of each Spartan distance - Sprint, Super and Beast (or Ultra) - in a calendar year (January 1st - December 31st), anywhere in the world. You can earn multiple Trifectas in a single year, however only one lap per day, per event will count toward this accomplishment.  (If you run in both the Elite and Open series, still only ONE run through the course, per day, per event will count towards a trifecta.)The Hurricane heat does not count toward a Trifecta.Stadium Sprints do count as a ""Sprint"" towards the Trifecta.The entire Ultra course needs to be completed for it to count. Only completing half does not result in a ""Beast"" towards your Trifecta.You can run the races in any order, the sprint does not need to be the first event.There is nothing special that you will need to do to ""claim"" a trifecta medal, as you will earn the three pieces of it, as you complete your races during the season. Once you have your third piece, the medals will fit together to complete one big Trifecta medal. If you are earning your 2x, 3x, etc. Trifecta medal, they are available on site at the event. Please complete your race, then see our results tent and/or our announcer booth to be presented with your multi-Trifecta medal.Trifecta merchandise (shirts, medal holders, etc.) will be available for sale at the merchandise tent at all events, but no additional merchandise, other than medal pieces, will be provided to Trifecta finishers.Please note: Starting in 2015 all races in the world will award the Trifecta medal pieces. There are no single trifecta medals for any country.*You do not need the trifecta pass to earn the Spartan Trifecta.Was this article helpful? 11 out of 16 found this helpfulHave more questions?

The Ultra Beast event will count as a Beast toward your trifecta. So, if a person completes a Sprint, Super and Ultra Beast, they'll be all set! Thanks for adding that!0Fernando C June 16, 2014 14:50If I complete the three events in a year, what do I need to do to get the Trifecta medal?1Luke Rutherford June 16, 2014 18:30They just know... They keep track of your registration and completed races and there is usually a booth near (after) the finish line that verifies your completion and rewards you with the trifecta medal.0Aja Varney June 17, 2014 06:31In 2014, there is nothing special that you will need to do to ""claim"" a trifecta medal, as you will earn the three pieces of it, as you complete your races during the season. Once you have your third piece, the medals will fit together to complete one big Trifecta medal!0Fernando C June 17, 2014 06:44Thank you all for your comments... I guess I missed the piece of medal on the previous Super Spartan I completed, will look for it this next time. Thanks!0Fernando C June 17, 2014 07:53I ran the Miami Super Spartan a couple years ago... and I didn't realize I should have gotten the piece of medal. Still, I'm planning to do the three distances this same year, can't wait to complete the Trifecta!!0Aja Varney June 17, 2014 07:55Fernando, Oops, sorry for the confusion, I should clarify: The piece medals are only for 2014. In previous years we had given out the full round medals for each event and then a separate medal for the trifecta.0Fernando C June 17, 2014 07:59No problem, thanks for all your help Aja. Look forward to earn those three pieces this year then!!0Luke Rutherford June 17, 2014 17:09I do have a related question. Is it possible to change race types on the day of the race? For instance, I am currently registered in the Vermont Sprint, but if I decided to change to the Ultra Beast the morning of the race, would this be possible? Right now I don't think I could complete the Beast on Saturday and then the Ultra Beast the next day, but if I wake up and feel ever so possessed to change to the Ultra Beast, would this be possible?0Aja Varney June 17, 2014 17:17Luke, You can check on more information regarding our transfers here: https://spartanrace.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/2023289280Adamsmith9 June 24, 2014 13:25For 2014, is there a way to still get the separate Trifecta medal? I like that much more than the individuals pieces ...0Aja Varney June 24, 2014 13:27Adam, At this time we will not be providing a separate Trifecta medal, since all three pieces join together to form it. Thanks for your feedback, though!0Charles Le June 24, 2014 15:51Is there still a full bigger trifecta medal when completing multiple trifectas in a year?0Aja Varney June 24, 2014 15:53Charles, There is! While the single trifecta medal is made up of your ""pieces"" there are still separate medals for Multiple Trifecta Finishers! These can be claimed at the Merch Tent and/or Future Registration tent at any event, after you complete your required events!0Luke Rutherford June 24, 2014 18:39But there is still a way to get the seperate trifecta medal! If you complete your final race in Canada you should be able to receive the full trifecta completion medal as we have not changed to the pie piece style. Also, the medals this year for the Sprint, Super, and Beast are AWESOME! I'd recommend coming to Ottawa for the Beast in several weeks :) One thing I'm not certain of though is whether the other, non-Beast races would have the trifecta medal available at them, as the Ottawa Beast is Canada's first and only Beast race...unfortunately. Bottom line, we're still using the old style trifecta medal format!0Luke Rutherford June 24, 2014 18:40Correction...there is also a Beast at Sun Peaks, which is in BC.0Akdocbruce June 25, 2014 10:52I read somewhere to complete Trifecta, it wasn't a calendar year, but 12 months after your first race...has this changed? Some people begin their first Spartan race in November or December0CorandTim June 30, 2014 09:06We will be completing our Trifecta in Red Deer, Canada, at the Super. When I clicked on ""claim"" after the Salt Lake City Beast, it doesn't show us also having completed the Flathead Lake sprint in Montana this past May, it only shows we completed the Beast. How will they know to add us to the 2014 Trifecta Tribe list, after we complete the Super then? As well, in Montana instead of the usual red spartan metal that accompanied our 1/3 of the trifecta medal, we got the black head with the spikes around it. What's this?0Ed McKenna June 30, 2014 14:25Hello, I did an invitational on April 14, 2014 at the Reebok Complex in Stoughton MA will that be considered as a sprint? Also I did a super in Quebec on June 22, 2014 so I can a get a different medal so they all can fit together? Thank you, Ed McKenna0Aja Varney July 02, 2014 12:01Everyone, as noted in the article above, if you do a single event towards your trifecta in a country other than the US, you will need to contact us (email) to receive the ""piece"" medal, as our international partners are only providing the previous round medal.International races WILL be taken into account for 2014 Trifecta standings as long as they are associated with your Athlinks Profile. Please see this related article, regarding the Spartan Point Series, for more information on Claiming your results through Athlinks, and making sure they're all associated with your profile: https://spartanrace.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202641333-Spartan-Point-Series-and-Ranking0Aja Varney July 02, 2014 12:02@Ed, Our Invitational Event, as well as any Stadium Series events will absolutely count as Sprint towards your trifecta.0Robin Ubaldini July 08, 2014 09:34My husband has just participated in his second death race. I am inspired by him and now want to set the goal of completing a trifecta. Could you please clarify 1. do stadium races count towards the trifecta and 2. Is a trifecta by calendar year or by the date of your first race? Thank you!0Aja Varney July 08, 2014 09:37Hi Robin, As noted in the article above, Stadium Races count as a Sprint towards your trifecta. Additionally, Trifecta is Calendar Year only - you must complete all three distances in one calendar year.0Frank Treto July 24, 2014 11:06I have 2 questions. I read all of the posts on here but did not find anything on what I want to know. I keep reading about the 3 pieces ""fit together"" to make a bigger medal. I'm sure they'll fit together. My first question is, is there anything being given to us to hold all 3 pieces together? or do the medals somehow connect to each other and stay in tack?My second question is, I did my Spartan Sprint using 1 email account and I'm going to do the Spartan Beast in Ottawa with a different email. Is Spartan going to keep track of those 2 races towards my trifecta or is there something special I have to do so you guys can track?Thank you.0William Brumbach July 26, 2014 16:45I'm going for multiple trifectas this year. I notice that only one lap per event counts towards an ""official"" trifecta. Since Ohio is offering all three events on the same day and I already have one trifecta so far, if I run each distance that day, will that count towards an additional trifecta for one of the larger multiple trifecta medals?0Aja Varney July 26, 2014 19:44Hi Frank! The three wedge pieces are actually magnetized, so they stick together, once you get all three, to make a full trifecta medal! In regard to your three trifecta races, we will keep track and can verify based on your date of birth, etc. For future reference, it is easier all around if you choose one email address and stick with it all race season - BUT, we'll get you either way.0Aja Varney July 26, 2014 19:46Hey Bill!You're exactly right. If you run Ohio for the Trifecta-in-a-day, it is a full ""official"" trifecta (as you will have run all three distances). SO, if you already have one trifecta completed and then you do Ohio Trifecta-in-a-day, we will VERY proudly award you your Double Trifecta medal at the end of the day!0Reymart Carandang July 29, 2014 16:30For the trifecta, If I do the San Francisco Sprint in August, do I have to do the Super and Beast in this calendar year to get the trifecta, or do I have until next August to get it?0Aja Varney July 30, 2014 07:47Hi Reymart, per the article above: ""A member of the Spartan Trifecta Tribe finishes on of each Spartan distance - Sprint, Super and Beast - in a calendar year (January 1st - December 31st), anywhere in the world."" So, if you do the Sprint in August, you have until December 31 to do a Super and a Beast to finish your Trifecta!1 2 3 4 5 6 › »Article is closed for comments."
