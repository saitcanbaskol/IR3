It is also used to treat a certain type of irregular heartbeat ( chronic atrial fibrillation ). Treating heart failure may help maintain your ability to walk and exercise and may improve the strength of your heart. Treating an irregular heartbeat can decrease the risk for blood clots, an effect that may reduce your risk for a heart attack or stroke.Digoxin belongs to a class of medications called cardiac glycosides. It works by affecting certain minerals ( sodium and potassium) inside heart cells. This reduces strain on the heart and helps it maintain a normal, steady, and strong heartbeat.Digoxin is available under the following different brand names: Lanoxin.Dosage of Digoxin:Adult and Pediatric Dosage Forms and StrengthsOral solution0.05 mg /mLInjectable solution0.1 mg/mL0.25 mg/mLTablet0.0625 mg (Lanoxin only) (adult only)0.125 mg0.1875 mg (Lanoxin only) (adult only)0.25 mgAtrial FibrillationRapid digitalizing (loading-dose) regimenIntravenous  (IV): 8-12 mcg/kg (0.008-0.012 mg/kg) total loading dose; administer 50% initially; then may cautiously give 1/4 the loading dose every 6-8 hours twice; perform careful assessment of clinical response and toxicity before each doseOral: 10-15 mcg/kg total loading dose; administer 50% initially; then may cautiously give 1/4 the loading dose every 6-8 hours twice; perform careful assessment of clinical response and toxicity before each doseMaintenanceOral: 3.4-5.1 mcg/kg/day or 0.125-0.5 mg/day orally; may increase dose every 2 weeks based on clinical response, serum drug levels, and toxicityIntravenous/ intramuscular  (IV/IM): 0.1-0.4 mg once/day; IM route not preferred due to severe injection site reactionHeart FailureAs per ACCF/AHA guidelines, a loading dose to initiate digoxin therapy in patients with heart failure is not necessary0.125-0.25 mg orally/IV once/day; higher doses including 0.375-0.5 mg/day rarely neededUse lower end of dosing (0.125 mg/day) in patients with impaired renal function or low lean body massHeart Failure/Atrial Fibrillation, PediatricUse doses at the lower end of the spectrum when treating heart failureReduce dose by 20-25% when changing from oral formulation or intramuscular (IM) to intravenous (IV) therapyPremature neonateOral: 1st loading dose, 10-15 mcg/kg; 2nd and 3rd loading doses, 5-7.5 mcg/kg every 6-8 hours for 2 doses; maintenance: 5-7.5 mcg/kg/day divided every 12 hoursIntravenous/intramuscular (IV/IM): 1st loading dose, 7.5-12.5 mcg/kg; 2nd and 3rd loading doses, 3.75-6.25 mcg/kg every 6-8 hours for 2 doses; maintenance: 4-6 mcg/kg/day divided every 12 hoursFull-term neonateOral: 1st loading dose, 12.5-17.5 mcg/kg; 2nd and 3rd loading doses, 6.25-8.75 mcg/kg every 6-8 hours for 2 doses; maintenance: 6-10 mcg/kg/day divided every 12 hoursIV/IM: 1st loading dose, 10-15 mcg/kg; 2nd and 3rd loading doses, 5-7.5 mcg/kg every 6-8 hours for 2 doses; maintenance: 5-8 mcg/kg/day divided every 12 hoursInfants and children 1-24 monthsOral: 1st loading dose, 17.5-30 mcg/kg; 2nd and 3rd loading doses, 8.75-15 mcg/kg every 6-8 hours for 2 doses; maintenance: 10-15 mcg/kg/day divided every 12 hoursIV/IM: 1st loading dose, 15-25 mcg/kg; 2nd and 3rd loading doses, 7.5-12.5 mcg/kg every 6-8 hours for 2 doses; maintenance: 7.5-12 mcg/kg/day divided every 12 hours2-5 yearsOral: 1st loading dose, 15-20 mcg/kg; 2nd and 3rd loading doses, 8.75-10 mcg/kg every 6-8 hours for 2 doses; maintenance: 7.5-10 mcg/kg/day divided every 12 hoursIV/IM: 1st loading dose, 12.5-17.5 mcg/kg; 2nd and 3rd loading doses, 6.25-8.75 mcg/kg every 6-8 hours for 2 doses; maintenance: 6-9 mcg/kg/day divided every 12 hours5-10 yearsOral: 1st loading dose, 10-17.5 mcg/kg; 2nd and 3rd loading doses, 5-8.75 mcg/kg every 6-8 hours for 2 doses; maintenance: 5-10 mcg/kg/day divided every 12 hoursIV/IM: 1st loading dose, 7.5-15 mcg/kg; 2nd and 3rd loading doses, 3.75-7.5 mcg/kg every 6-8 hours for 2 doses; maintenance: 4-8 mcg/kg/day divided every 12 hoursOlder than 10 years and less than 100 kgOral: 1st loading dose, 5-7.5 mcg/kg; 2nd and 3rd loading doses, 2.5-3.75 mcg/kg every 6-8 hours for 2 doses; maintenance: 2.5-5 mcg/kg/dayIV/IM: 1st loading dose, 4-6 mcg/kg; 2nd and 3rd loading doses, 2-3 mcg/kg every 6-8 hours for 2 doses; maintenance: 2-3 mcg/kg/dayDosing ModificationsAdjust maintenance dose by estimating renal clearance and measuring serum levelsIn heart failure, higher dosages have no additional benefit and may increase toxicity; decreased renal clearance may lead to increased toxicityIn geriatric patients, use lean body weight to calculate doseWhat Are Side Effects Associated with Using Digoxin?Common Side effects of Digoxin include:DizzinessMental disturbancesDiarrheaHeadacheNauseaVomitingRed, bumpy rashLess common side effects of digoxin include:Loss of appetiteIrregular heartbeatArrhythmia in children (consider a toxicity)Other side effects of digoxin include:Visual disturbance (blurred or yellow vision)Heart block  (1°/2°/3°)Cardiac arrest rhythm ( asystole)Fast heart rateThis document does not contain all possible side effects and others may occur.

In case of overdose, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center immediatelyContraindicationsHypersensitivityVentricular fibrillationEffects of Drug AbuseNo information availableShort-Term EffectsSee ""What Are Side Effects Associated with Using Digoxin?""Long-Term EffectsSee ""What Are Side Effects Associated with Using Digoxin?""CautionsUse caution in chronic constrictive pericarditis, electrical cardioversion, severe bradycardia, severe heart failure, severe pulmonary disease, sick sinus syndrome, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular premature contractions,Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, electrolyte imbalance, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, hypoxia, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, renal disease, concomitant diuretics . Not recommended in patients with acute myocardial infarction.Avoid in patients with myocarditis.Risk of advanced or complete heart block in patients with sinus node disease and AV block.Very narrow margin between effective therapeutic and toxic dosages: Therapeutic range, 0.5-2 ng/mL (target 0.5-1 ng/mL); toxic range, greater than 2.5 ng/mL.Generally avoid if left ventricular systolic function preserved, although may be used for ventricular rate control in subgroup with chronic atrial fibrillation.Less effective in presence of hypokalemia or hypocalcemia; avoid hypercalcemia or hypomagnesemia, which may predispose to serious arrhythmias.Heart failure patients with preserved ventricular function including acute cor pulmonale, amyloid heart disease, and constrictive pericarditis may be susceptible to digoxin toxicity.May cause false-positive ST-T changes during exercise testing.Do not switch between different oral forms or between brand and generic forms of digoxin; bioavailability varies.Serum levels drawn within 6-8 hours of dose will be falsely high because of prolonged distribution phase.Increased risk of estrogen -like effects in geriatric patients.Beriberi heart disease may not respond adequately if underlying thiamine deficiency not corrected.Atrial arrhythmias are difficult to treat if associated with hypermetabolic (hyperthyroidism) or hyperdynamic (hypoxia) states; treat underlying condition before initiating therapy.Avoid extravasation; ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during administration.Monitor for pro- arrhythmic effects, especially with digoxin toxicity.Use caution in patients with acute myocardial infarction; may increase myocardial oxygen demand; during acute coronary syndrome, digoxin administered intravenously (IV) may be used to slow a rapid ventricular response and improve left ventricular function in the acute treatment of atrial fibrillation associated with severe LV function and heart failure or hemodynamic instability.Monitor serum concentration closely when used for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation; serum concentration that are not properly controlled are associated with increased risk of mortality.Consider use of digoxin only in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction when symptoms remain despite guideline-directed medical therapy; withdrawal of digoxin in clinically stable patients with heart failure may lead to recurrence of heart failure symptoms.In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, outflow obstruction may worsen due to positive inotropic effects of digoxin; avoid use unless used to control ventricular response with atrial fibrillation; in the absence of atrial fibrillation, digoxin is potentially harmful in the treatment of dyspnea in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Avoid rapid IV administration in digitalized patients; may produce serious arrhythmias.Not necessary to routinely reduce or hold digoxin therapy prior to elective electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation; however, exclusion of digoxin toxicity is necessary prior to cardioversion; withhold digoxin and delay cardioversion until toxicity subsides if signs of digoxin excess exist.Pregnancy and LactationUse digoxin with caution during pregnancy if benefits outweigh risksAnimal studies show risk and human studies are not available, or neither animal nor human studies were doneDigoxin enters breast milk; use with caution if breastfeeding  ( American Academy of Pediatrics committee states, ""compatible with nursing "")FromHealthy Heart ResourcesLiving With Heart Failure8 Heart Tests You May Need With Type 2 DiabetesFeatured CentersHow Could You Live Better With Migraine?Not Being Defined by Your CancerTrack Cold & Flu in Your AreaHealth Solutions From Our SponsorsFrequent Constipation?Greater Food AccessibilityReviewed on 5/30/2017Medscape.
