"What app do you like best for walking? There are two basic types of walking apps. There are those that track your walking workouts and use GPS or step cadence for speed and distance, and pedometer apps that track your all-day steps and activity using the accelerometer chip in your mobile phone.Some apps are more workout-based while others allow you to track workouts and all-day activity. These apps are all available for free, although they also have an opportunity for an upgrade or in-app purchases.1 Map My WalkMapMyFitness Screen CaptureMapMyWalk is part of the MapMyFitness family of apps.

The map allows you to explore, and by seeing where you've walked so far you'll be able to find your way back to where you started.As you walk, you can see the elapsed time, distance, pace, speed, elevation, and calories burned.
