This is a logarithmic scale like all dB, but is weighted for frequency response.  A man with normal hearing can just perceive 0 dB. The scale was in fact designed with this in mind.  At the other end of the scale is the ""pain threshold"" where sound starts to cause pain. For most people this in the region of 110dB - 120 dB.
