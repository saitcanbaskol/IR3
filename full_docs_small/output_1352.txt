"How Much Does AT&T Charge for Text Message Overage?Going over your 1000 text message limit will cost you .10 cents extra per message. Text messaging costs the average AT&T customer $10 per month for 1000 text messages whether you use them or not. $20 per month will get you the unlimited Domestic text plan. It doesn't sound like a lot until you go over your text messaging limit which can add up or if you send International text messages. Domestic text rates do not apply for International text messages. Charges for international messages sent from the U.S. are $0.25 for Text Messages and $0.50 for Picture/Video Messages. Charges for usage while roaming internationally: $0.50 for each text message sent, $1.30 for each picture/video message sent, and $0.0195 for each kilobyte used. Standard rates apply to all incoming messages as well. We estimate that each wireless customefreer generates .33 cents in revenue per day for text messages which is roughly a $10 billion dollar per year business for AT&T or $30 million dollars per day. Its also pretty ironic that AT&T  (NYSE: T) pays $10 billion dollars per year in dividends. Coincidence or a house of cards that is wait to fall? Here are 10 other reasons why charging for text messaging is a scam. What if you could save $60 - $240 per year in text messages with free text messaging services? The average AT&T customer sends out 621 text messages per month which is approximately 20 messages per day. The cost of text messaging is .33 cents per day which does not sound like a lot. Free text messaging is growing with companies like Facebook, Google Voice and Apple getting into the game. Our thesis is that the handset and software manufactures Apple, Google & Microsoft will soon be getting into the data delivery business and will be subsiding messaging with mobile advertisements.by Jeff Cohn at 5/26/2011 1 CommentRelated Articles: Apple , ATT Wireless , Facebook , Free Wireless , Google Voice , Microsoft , Save Money , Scam , Telecom Industry Insider , Text Messaging , Twitter"
