"Difference Between Culture and Civilization• Categorized under Culture, Miscellaneous | Difference Between Culture and CivilizationCulture Vs CivilizationFirstly, civilization in theory is bigger than culture in which an entire civilization can encompass one single unit of culture. Civilization is a bigger unit than culture because it is a complex aggregate of the society that dwells within a certain area, along with its forms of government, norms, and even culture. Thus, culture is just a spec or a portion of an entire civilization. For example, the Egyptian civilization has an Egyptian culture in the same way as the Greek civilization has their Greek culture.A culture ordinarily exists within a civilization. In this regard, each civilization can contain not only one but several cultures. Comparing culture and civilization is like showing the difference between language and the country to which it is being used.Culture can exist in itself whereas civilization cannot be called a civilization if it does not possess a certain culture. It’s just like asking how a nation can exist on its own without the use of a medium of communication. Hence, a civilization will become empty if it does not have its culture, no matter how little it is.Culture can be something that is tangible and it can also be something that isn’t. Culture can become a physical material if it is a product of the beliefs, customs and practices of a certain people with a definite culture. But a civilization is something that can be seen as a whole and it is more or less tangible although its basic components, like culture, can be immaterial.Culture can be learned and in the same manner it can also be transmitted from one generation to the next. Using a medium of speech and communication, it is possible for a certain type of culture to evolve and even be inherited by another group of people. On the other hand, civilization cannot be transferred by mere language alone. Because of its complexity and magnitude, you need to transfer all of the raw aggregates of a civilization for it to be entirely passed on. It just grows, degrades and may eventually end if all its subunits will fail. Summary :1.Culture is by definition smaller than a civilization. 2.Culture can grow and exist without residing in a formal civilization whereas a civilization will never grow and exist without the element of culture. 3.Culture can be tangible or intangible whereas civilization is something that is more tangible because it is what you see as a whole 4.Culture can be transmitted through symbols in the form of language whereas an entire civilization cannot be transmitted by mere language alone.Facebook Pinterest Twitter Google+ Print ShareSearch DifferenceBetween.net :Custom SearchHelp us improve.
