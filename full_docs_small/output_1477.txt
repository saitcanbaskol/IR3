"Getting an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) and using an EAD are two entirely different things. Using an EAD means working based on that EAD, and that means when you join any company you must sign an I-9 form in which employment eligibility  is based on the EAD. The person can change from H1 status to  EAD status by contacting their HR department and filling out an I9 form again based on EAD. Similarly, getting an Advance Parole (AP) and using an AP are two entirely different things. Using an AP means leaving the U.S. and then showing your AP to enter the U.S. as a parolee, instead of showing the visa to enter the U.S. as a nonimmigrant. As parolees can't work in the U.S., he/she should get an  EAD before traveling on an AP. Receiving an AP is just  an addition of one more document in your file. Just receiving an EAD/AP does not change the nonimmigrant status  in any way, and he/she is still on H or L status; thus, the person is  either in EAD/AP status or in H/L status. As long as a person maintains an H/L status (H/L status not expired, H1/L1 holders working only for their sponsoring employer, and H4/L2 holders not working at all), he/she can travel outside the U.S. and come back without the need for  advanced parole even after applying for an adjustment of status. The  person can enter using his/her non-expired H/L visa. Effective Nov 1, 2007, the person    does NOT need  to carry his/her ""original"" I-485 receipt . For valid H/L  visa holders, there is no need to apply for EAD to continue working after returning to the U.S. If you are not planning to travel or work part-time for another employer, there is no reason to apply for an EAD. On the other hand, there is no harm in applying for advance parole and an EAD. As well, t here is no reason  to try to maintain nonimmigrant status after filing for adjustment of status,  unless your 6-year H/L visa limit is about to be reached and you have  no option other than to work with EAD/AP. Please note that it is possible to get  your H-1B visa approved for more than 6 years  in some cases, depending upon your employment-based  green card processing status. Please refer to H1 beyond 6 years to find out more about how you can extend your  H-1B visa for more than 6 years, either 1 year at a time or 3 years at a time. If an H1/H4 visa holder opts for EAD/AP, it allows the H4 spouse to work for any company and the H1 primary applicant for another part-time job or side business without any need to file for an H1B visa, as long as the primary applicant keeps working for the  employer who filed his/her green card. If you opt for EAD/AP status, a spouse (and children, if any) acquired  after using your AP may not join on H4, and can't resume H/L status after I-485  denial, if any. But you can work for more than one employer, and your  spouse can work. It's your decision whether to remain in nonimmigrant status or to be  in EAD/AP status. Applicants  maintaining H/L status may travel immediately after filing the I-485, provided  they have a valid H/L visa in their passport, or they obtain a new one. Advance  parole applications take at least 3 months, during which you can't travel if are not  in valid H/L status. H-1B/L1 workers who file a timely application for an extension  of stay may continue employment for 240 days while USCIS adjudicates the petition, and you  are not allowed to work on an expired EAD while your renewal EAD application is pending.  Moreover, you have to apply for EAD ever year. Adjustment of status applicants who have used an  EAD card due to their 6 year limit on H/L visa expiring, or by working for any  other employer other than sponsoring employer, are no longer in  their nonimmigrant status. Advance parole allows them to travel abroad and  return to the U.S. without a visa. In general, if the person is married, he/she may want to apply for  an EAD for both, so that their spouse can start working and he/she  can also work part-time for another employer if he/she wishes. If  the person is single, he/she may want to maintain H/L status so  that he/she can bring his/her spouse on H4 if he/she gets married  before adjustment of status application is approved. Some H-1B professionals use EAD (and terminate H-1B) on purpose  to save H-1B time, so if something happens with the current  employer they are able to pick up the remaining period of the 6-year  H-1B limit through another H-1B approval with the new employer.  That H1 approval would then be a new H-1B and not a transfer of H-1B, hence  it would be subject to annual H-1B visa. Also see Dependents and Marriage ."
