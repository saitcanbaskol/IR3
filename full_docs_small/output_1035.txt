"Up to the year 2005, the estimated population of Osaka was 2,640,097, while its density was 11,894 persons per sq. kilometers. This is about 7% of the total population Japan, and it ranks second to that of the Tokyo Prefecture. The people of Osaka speak a dialect that belongs to the standard Japanese. It is known as the Osaka-ben, which is more distinctly evident among other specific groups, which employ the suffix ‘–hen' instead of the negative verb, ‘nai'. The Osaka-ben is a dialect that is confined to Osaka and its precincts, but not through the entire Kansai region. There are around 118,000 foreign residents who are registered in the city. Of them, 91,500 are Korean which is concentrated around the Ikuno ward which is home to a famed Korean center, namely Tsuruhashi. As far as the question of space is concerned, Osaka is relatively small in terms of space which is around 213 sq. kilometers. Most of the land has seen the outcome of large scale urbanization. A third of the area was consumed by the fire during WWII. In the post-war era, the city had to cope with an overwhelming dearth of housing facilities for its citizens. In 1968, the lodging units, for the first time, exceeded the number of existing households. However, an enhanced standard of living resulted in the citizens demanding better accommodation amenities and diversified dwellings. In fact there are still several areas where there are decrepit units. Situated approximately on the heart of Japan, Osaka City is the center of the Greater Metropolitan Area of Osaka, which is vibrant in the field of politics, economy, culture and the like. It should be noted that the day to night population is high in Osaka and Tokyo, while it is low in the neighboring territories. The 2.6 million population of the city rises to 3.8 during the daytime. A declining rate in the daytime population was noted in 2000 in Osaka as well as 17 other cities. Of the entire populace which touched more than 2,700,000 by August 2003, 61% is the rate of the working population. The percentage of working population in the tertiary sector was almost 66%. With all the diverse demands of the modern economy to meet with, Osaka and its thriving populace constitute the political composition, national economy and the assorted activities of the kingdom. The demography of Osaka is peculiar in that it lends the place a distinct flavor of its own so that it stands out in the miscellany of the other prefectures of the Archipelago."
