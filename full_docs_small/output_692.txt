"inluvwithAK Wasilla, AlaskaReviewed April 23, 2012 Mauna Kea Visitor's CenterWe decided Not to go up to the summit not only due to the higher altitude (I have asthma), but also because many people told us it really isn't worth it. The drive is easy and good with paved road all the way to the Visitor's Center. We watched a one hour video about the mountain and the observatory. It had a strong political correctness to it, but if you get past that, it was informative. It was followed by an excellent 15 minute talk from one of the knowledgeable staff members and answering questions. Many telescopes were moved outside where we could see the planets, nebula, etc. The same staff member used a laser pointer to point out various stars, clusters, planets and more. If it were not for the idiots snapping their cameras, using their flashlights, we would have seen more. It takes almost 30 minutes to really acclimate to the night sky. The staff continually asked people not to use flash photography, but there are always the few that don't listen, and don't watch their children. We were told by other people who have been to the summit that it was not worth the money just to walk around and see the observatories (obviously you can't use the telescopes as they are for research, etc). So, in conclusion, I would have to say that due to all the tourist vehicles, people with flash cameras and car lights, it took away from the experience, and we saw more stars and night sky over at Volcanoes National Park, even though the elevation was about 5000 feet less. If you were to arrive later at the visitor's center when the tourist vehicles are returning to town, and people are heading back to their destinations, then I think it would be an amazing experience. I suggest getting their later around 8. We arrived at 6 to watch the film and listen to the staff talk, but you can do that if you arrive later as well.Ask inluvwithAK about Mauna Kea23 Thank inluvwithAKThis review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC."
