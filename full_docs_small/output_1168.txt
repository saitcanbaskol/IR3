You will find your flame spreader (flat metal plate), remove that one and you will see the glow bar igniter (see the image below). Now start your oven, and here you will see two things happening, first your igniter is not glowing red, second it's glowing red but your oven is not coming on. Next I am going to talk about each one of them.FIRST: If your igniter is not glowing red, then it might be burned out. Here is how you can troubleshoot it: Make sure to unplug your oven. You need to use a multimeter (click here to learn how to use a multimeter ). We need to disconnect the wire harness that is connected to the igniter. Sometimes the igniter wire harness can be disonected from inside the oven and sometimes we have to pull the oven out and get it from the back by removing the back panel, grab the multimeter and set it on volt reading. Get ready to hook up the multimeter two probes to where the igniter was connected after you plug and start your oven. If your meter reads about 120 volts, then your glow bar igniter is definitely defective. Another way to test your igniter is to check for continuity or resistance. Set your multimeter to Ohms or Resistance and put your two probes on the igniter wire harness. If you get no resistance or no continuity, then your igniter is burned out and need to be replaced. The manufacturer part number for your igniter is 316489400. You can buy it online from Appliance Parts Pros, and you should be able to install it by yourself. They even have a video showing you how to install it.SECOND: If your igniter is glowing red but your oven is not coming on, then it might be still bad igniter and need to be replaced. Here is how you can tell:Grab the multimeter and set it to read for amps. What we want to check here, is the amount of the amperage that is going through the igniter. A normal igniter will have about 3.2 to 3.6 amps current flowing in the igniter. All you have to do is to put your multimeter two probes on the safety gas valve terminals. If your meter is reading anything below 3.2 amps, then you got a weak igniter and you need to replace it. Again your oven igniter part number is 316489400.But if your meter reads above 3.2 amps, then the igniter is just fine. So what is wrong with my oven you will say?
