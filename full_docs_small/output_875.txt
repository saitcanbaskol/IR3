"Alabama LivingSo you snag an alligator, now what do you do with it? You cook it, naturallyPosted August 23, 2014 at 7:27 AMCommentBy David Hollowaydholloway@al.comAlligator tail meat has a distinctive flavor that some have likened to chicken. The front portions are somewhat stronger, but all of the meat is good in a variety of recipes. (Sharon Steinmann/ssteinmann@al.com)MOBILE, Alabama -- OK, so you've decided to take part in Alabama's annual alligator hunting season and for some weird good luck or whatever, you are fortunate enough to bag one of the massive beasts.Now what do you do?Well, the short answer is you eat it. With the state's alligator hunting season winding down there will be a number of folks who will suddenly find themselves with an abundance of fresh alligator meat with no clue how to cook it.Relax, that's what they pay me for. I'm here to offer a few tips for preparing what, for many people, is an exotic meat. Yes, in fact they taste like chicken. Honestly. They are, however, a tad gamier than fowl. I personally love blackened alligator, or fried.Let me say for the record that I have never actually caught an alligator on purpose. Like a lot of amateur anglers I have occasionally snagged the errant gator whilst fishing, but I have never actually boated one or brought it home for food.But I have cooked alligator on a number of occasions and have some experience in preparing a few tasty dishes.So in prepping for this I did what most folks do -- I trolled about on the Internet and found a lot of resources on the subject.Since I've never caught an alligator on purpose it's a safe bet that I've never actually cleaned one. But again, the Internet is loaded with tons of instructional videos and other tips on how to best remove the meat from the hide without tearing it up.Once you get the meat from the hide, the fun starts. That's when we get to eating and cooking.Now, most people are familiar with eating alligator meat that has been seasoned, deep fried and served with a dipping sauce as an appetizer or first course. This meat comes primarily from the tail section of the alligator.And before you can ask, the answer is yes, it does taste somewhat like chicken.But what folks may not realize, you can also harvest meat from the front section. The meat from the legs and the body is somewhat darker and may have a stronger, some say gamier, flavor. But it is still very good and great in a variety of recipes that require a long, slow braise in a liquid.A lot of folks like to take the meat and grind it up for sausage and other applications that require blending the wild gator with pork. This does a couple of things, not the least of which is providing much needed fat to the mix, and some very good pork flavor.I don't know if you've ever eaten snapping turtle, but alligator is very much akin to it in flavor and texture. And that only makes good sense since the two creatures have much the same dining habits and live in pretty much the same part of the world.The fillet of the alligator is much prized. It is located near the tail area and, as with fillets from other creatures, is very tender and very juicy.These recipes are from a wonderful book, a great resource on how to cook just about anything that is found in the wild in the Southern United States. Chef John Folse's delightful ""After the Hunt: Louisiana's Authoritative Collection of Wild Game and Fish Cookery"" is a huge, detailed, fun account of just about everything anybody can think of. If you're looking for a Christmas gift for the hunter and fisherman in your life, this is it.Finally, you can freeze alligator for up to six months. I think to be safe, the best way to vacuum pack it and to label it so that it doesn't get lost in the depths of your deep freeze; trust me on this.Cajun-Fried Alligator Tail6-8 servingsIngredients:3 pounds alligator tail, cut into ¾-inch cubes1 onion, sliced2 cups salad oil1 cup red wine vinegar1 tablespoon dried basil1 teaspoon dried tarragon3 cups cold waterVegetable oil, for frying2 eggs, beaten1 cup milk1 cup waterSalt and cayenne pepper, to tasteGranulated garlic, to taste3 cups seasoned corn flour or fish fry mixInstructions:In a large mixing bowl, combine onion, salad oil, red wine vinegar, basil, tarragon and cold water and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour.
