In keeping with its aristocratic heritage, Aix quietly exudes well-bred suavity and elegance—indeed, it is now one of the 10 richest townships in France. The influence and power it once had as the old capital of Provence—fine art, noble architecture, and graceful urban design—remain equally important to the city today. And, although it is true that Aix owns up to a few modern-day eyesores, the overall impression is one of beautifully preserved stone monuments, quietly sophisticated nightlife, leafy plane trees, and gently splashing fountains. With its thriving market, vibrant café life, spectacularly chic shops, and superlative music festival, it's one Provence town that really should not be missed.Read MoreTop Experiences In Aix, Marseille, and the Central CoastHow to Pronounce Things in ProvenceEspecially among a people who cut their teeth on the Academie Française, that holy arbiter of the French language, there are variations allowed...Explore Aix-en-ProvenceSights 27Shopping 15Nightlife 7Performing Arts 4Restaurants 10Hotels 9Elsewhere In Aix, Marseille, and the Central CoastAubagneThis easygoing, plane tree-shaded market town (pronounced ""oh- bahn -yuh"") is proud of its native son, the dramatist, filmmaker, and chronicler...2 Restaurants1 Hotel8 Things To DoBandolAlthough its name means wine to most of the world, Bandol is also a popular and highly developed seaside resort town.
