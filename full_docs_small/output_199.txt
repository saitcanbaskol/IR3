Use the United States Rule to determine the balance due on the note at the date of maturity. (The Effective Date is the date the note was written.) Assume the year is not a leap year. Partial 3500 Payment Date January 9 2793.69 2716.41 Any help on this problem would be appreciated, what I am getting confused on is the United States Banker Rule.Follow Math Help Forum on Facebook and Google+Sep 30th 2010, 03:55 AM #2emakarovMHF ContributorJoined Oct 2009Posts 5,577Thanks 790It may happen that nobody in this forum knows what the United States Banker Rule is, so it is better to provide a definition.

Also, you may get better responses in the Business Math forum. Here is a definition of the US Rule: The US Rule determines interest paid on the loan after a partial payment is made before the due date of the loan. The partial payment pays the interest first for that given time and then a part of the principal. The interest for the remaining part of the loan is calculated on the new principal and the days since the partial payment. When applying the US Rule, the Banker's Rule is used to calculate the interest (360 days = 1 year and any fractional part of a year = exact number of days.)Follow Math Help Forum on Facebook and Google+Sep 30th 2010, 10:35 AM #4emakarovMHF ContributorJoined Oct 2009Posts 5,577Thanks 790Disclaimer: my specialization is mathematical logic.  (All calculations done in OpenOffice Calc.) Between the effective date and the partial payment date there are 238 date. Therefore, the interest on that date was 257.83. The partial payment is greater that that interest, so the balance of the payment is applied to the principle. Therefore, the new principle is 2757.83. Between the partial payment date and the maturity date there are 44 days, so the interest is 21.91. So, the balance due is 21.91.Follow Math Help Forum on Facebook and Google+"
