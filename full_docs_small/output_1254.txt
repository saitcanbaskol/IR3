"Homemade Vegan Doritos – 3 Different FlavorsMarch 4, 2014 by Cara 116 CommentsThe idea of making Homemade Vegan Doritos really originated from this Vegan Nacho Cheese Dorito seasoning recipe (pure genius) from Vegan Richa, which in return inspired me to take it one step further. I had to make them into chips! I know, shocker right? If you know me, you know about my chip obsession. So I browsed the ingredients list of that seasoning and went into my kitchen and made my own version (thank you again, Richa!) Oh and did I mention that I also created two more seasonings?! See below.RELATED: GF/V Cheese-ItsHow does Spicy Taco and Cool Ranch sound? Oh no she didn’t. Oh yes I did. Did I just say that to myself as myself? I must be crazy from the Cool Ranch…RELATED: Cool Ranch DipThe thought of making oven-baked Doritos really got me tickled with Nacho Cheese. I take my Doritos very seriously, friends. I have no clue when the last time I actually ate them however, it’s one of those foods that I have to stay away from for many reasons. One of which is because the moment I taste one it transports me back to junior high and something strange happens within me and I cannot stop eating. My fingers turn into raisins from sucking the delicious, yet abnormally and synthetically orange cheese off of them. May I confess something here? I actually used to eat Doritos for lunch. No, I don’t mean as an accompaniment to my lunch but AS lunch itself. With homemade cookies. Two of them, fresh out of the school’s cafeteria oven. And a can of Coke. God, where was the nutritional training back in 1990?! And my generation wonders why we hit our 30s and all of a sudden these health problems show up randomly…RELATED: Vegan Sour Cream & Onion ChipsAt least we need no nutritional info with these homemade chips. I love it when I know what is going into my food and I never have to look up the pronunciation of an ingredient. Even more so, I love it when I can make my favorite foods within the comforts of my own kitchen and still feel satisfied.Sheer homemade vegan Doritos bliss…5.0 from 4 reviews Homemade Vegan Doritos (3 ways)Save PrintPrep time10 minsCook time15 minsTotal time25 minsAuthor: Fork & BeansServes: 48 chipsIngredients6 corn tortillas (make sure that these are on the thinner side--if not they will be crispy along the edges but a little chewier in the middle)1 Tbsp. olive oilSeasoning of choice (see above)InstructionsPreheat your oven to 350 degrees.
