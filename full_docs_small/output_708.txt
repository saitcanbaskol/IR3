"Hip-Hop Passes Rock As the Most Popular Genre in the U.SThe Nielsen numbers are in, and hip-hop and R&B now make up just over a quarter of America's music consumption.Donna-Claire Chesman Jul 18, 2017share tweetPhoto by Bryan Bedder/GettyWhen it comes to mid-term lists, Nielsen Music’s reports are the most comprehensive measures of audio consumption in the United States. Breaking down everything from streaming’s steady growth to the top songs per quarter, the report’s most notable finding is that for the first time in Nielsen’s history, hip-hop and R&B have overtaken rock as the most consumed genre in the country.Hip-hop and R&B come in at 25.1%, while Rock now only comprises 23% of America’s listening habits. We’re talking total song consumption here (or “digital song sales with streaming equivalent on-demand audio”) because rock albums purchases still make up over 40% of album sales in the US.Physicals aside, these numbers should not come as a surprise to anyone when we look at Nielsen’s top tracks of the mid-year: “The top streaming on-demand song (audio and video combined) is EdSheeran ’s ‘Shape of You,’ followed by Migos ’ (feat. Lil Uzi Vert) ‘Bad and Boujee’ and Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee’s (feat. Justin Bieber) ‘Despacito.’”Nielsen notes that “on-demand audio streams have reached over 184 billion streams so far in 2017, a considerable 62.4% increase over the same time period in 2016.” Pair that with the aforementioned top streaming songs all having a direct connection to hip-hop and R&B, and everything seamlessly comes together for the tides to change in hip-hop’s direction.Other victories for hip-hop include a mention that “Kendrick Lamar’sDAMN. is the leading album in total volume this year with total activity of more than 1.77 million units (albums, track equivalent albums and audio on-demand streaming equivalent albums combined)” and Drake’s More Life moved 1.69 million units. Following his big win at the Grammy’s, “Chance the Rapper’s Coloring Book led all album on-demand streams with a unit increase of over 15 million.”The full Nielsen Music Report can be downloaded here.RELATED STORIESDonna-Claire Chesman15 Freestyles From The 2000s You Need To WatchEric Isom 07.18.17Why am I Still Listening to British Radio in the U.S.?Pigeons 07.18.17Watch NowTagship-hopPopularin the CommunitySponsoredSponsoredEnter the Brockhampton House in Their New 'All-American Trash' DocumentaryGoldToast1dBurger King Foot LettuceCooking Up MF DOOM's Food References in the P&P Test KitchenErikOwen0022 AugRoger JinThe Story Behind One of the Best Album Covers of the Year, 6LACK's 'FREE 6LACK'RitikChandna24 Nov, 2016This album is sooo good10 New Rappers With The Most Ridiculous NamesGoldPalmtree5dhows og swaggerdick not on the list??Fans Keep Making Song Brackets For Their Favorite RappersOliveRadio15 MarSomeone make a Tyler the Creator one!New York Rapper Zillakami is Taking Hip-Hop to Brutal New ExtremesBluePlane16 Declmao you trying to be harder than heroin and murderJoji Explains Decision to Quit Filthy Frank and Pink Guy as He Pursues Music CareerRedDucky2 JanNOOO you were the chosen one anakin you were meant to help the force not hurt itPeople Really Want To Know Where Their Frank Ocean 'Endless' Vinyl IsBlueWheel14 FebNever shipping the vinyl would be illegal and prosecutable under the law.

But in 2017 ""hip hop & rnb"" barely even really exist anymoreReply Share 26PepeAvila SaschaCryou mean rock right?Reply Share 5KaraDavis237 SaschaCrHuh? Seems to me that its more relevant than ever based on this data. 20 years ago.....I never would have guessed that Hip-Hop would become a bigger export than Rock.....because well Rock is Rock. Rock is so sonically diverse and so much OLDER than Hip-Hop.....Reply Share 3MichaelBlesi SaschaCrJay, Kendrick, Joey, Rozay, Freddie, and Logic all dropped great albums this year, with the first 3 being straight up classics. People need to stop reminiscing while the culture moves forward, we'll have our kids looking back on 2017 as a great year for hip hop while complaining about the current state just like we are Reply Share 10Show 5 more repliesCélioCláudioIt's official, music is dyingReply Share 11ChristianNelson176 CélioCláudiolol okay budReply Share 32TerrancePitts CélioCláudioEvolving.
