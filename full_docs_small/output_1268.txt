First, she selected 12 of the greatest American popular ballads ever written. Then, David Terry set these songs to gigantic orchestral arrangements that swing, soar and dance--there's a propulsive beat behind an album that you might expect to be a solemn Big Production. Finally, Joni James sings these songs as if they are brand new, with all sorts of original insights and luxurious phrasing which often crosses over into jazz. This is the definitive version of ""My Funny Valentine."" But it's even topped by the thrilling recording of ""Don't Take Your Love From Me."" Everything here is a dream. As for the three previously-unreleased singles, they're all interesting but ""Tell the Moon To Go To Sleep,"" recorded at Joni's last singles recording session for M-G-M, ranks among the very best records she ever did. Regarding the arrangement of ""Sentimental Me"" mentioned by another reviewer, it's derived from the Ames Brother's earlier hit version of the song, a little tip of the musical hat from Joni as she reinvents the song but acknowledges an earlier effort. An incredible album you'd think was recorded just this year it's still so fresh and engaging. Read moreComment 14 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?

Rehder5.0 out of 5 stars Good Old Young JoniOctober 12, 2005Format: Audio CD Verified PurchaseI hesitated before ordering ""In the Still of the Night"" because it doesn't include her most famous pieces, but a favorable review I read pushed me over the top. Well worth the price: this is the authentic, touching, simple and direct Joni I remember from the 50s. Read moreComment 3 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Report abuseA customer5.0 out of 5 stars This CD makes my spirit soarMay 30, 2000Format: Audio CDI have all of Joni James's CDs. Although they're all great, this is one of my top favorites. The first dozen tracks are from the original album that was released in 1956, and they are first-rate. Ms. James's lovely singing in tandem with David Terry's atmospheric arrangements on these twelve songs truly convey to the listener the feeling of gazing at the stars on a clear, warm, peaceful, romantic night. The standouts are ""Stardust,"" ""But Not For Me,"" ""My Heart Stood Still,"" ""Fools Rush In,"" ""My Funny Valentine,"" ""Don't Take Your Love From Me,"" and ""My Reverie."" The climactic moment of ""My Funny Valentine,"" when Ms. James sings ""...stay little valentine, stay,"" is gorgeous and thrilling. ""Don't Take Your Love From Me"" features a great trumpet interlude. After hearing this album, I even started to like ""Someone To Watch Over Me,"" which was never one of my favorites. The last three are previously unreleased bonus tracks, which were recorded in the early 1960s. Ms. James does right by the oft-recorded ""More,"" and ""Tell The Moon To Go To Sleep"" is a hidden gem, now happily found. However, I must admit that I'm not fond of the song ""Sentimental Me,"" nor the arrangement with organ and back-up singers. That minor quibble notwithstanding, I love this CD.
