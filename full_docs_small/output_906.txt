"Science & Mathematics ChemistryIn an atom, where are electrons located?I know that they are outside the nucleus, but I want to get a little more detailed just to be sure.Follow 22 answersAnswersRelevanceRatingNewestOldestBest Answer: Electrons orbit the nucleus which is made up of protons and neutrons. This is an atom.... This diagram might help as well.Source (s):http://www.humanthermodynamics.com/Atom_diagram.jpgNwerdjim · 9 years ago7 0 1 commentAsker's ratingWhere Are Electrons LocatedSource (s):https://shrink.im/a8f2Wshank · 2 years ago0 0 CommentAn atom is made up of protons electron and nucleus. In the nucleus there are protons (they have a positive charge) and neutrons (neutral charge). The electrons are located in the shells outside the nucleus.Jay · 9 years ago2 0 Commentelectrons are way way far away from the center (nucleus) of the atom. lets say the nucleus was the size of a basketball, the electrons would be marbles that are flying around miles away from the nucleus. this is one of the greatest mysteries of the atom, it's really taxing on the imagination when you realize how much of the atom is made up of empty space, and then to think about how everything is made up of atoms, that means everything is nearly 99% empty space. Strange universe we live in.Source (s):memoryplaywithblades · 9 years ago3 0 CommentThe electrons that orbit a nucleus do so in pre-determined orbitals that start close to the nucleus and as the atom becomes larger the electrons fill in more orbitals further out from the nucleus. Orbitals are named, starting closest to the atom nucleus 1s2, 2s2, 2p6 and so on. Orbitals names can contains either s,p.d,f.g.h and all orbitals are filled in a specific order.davehuckleberry_55 · 9 years ago1 0 CommentIn the nucleus there are the neutrons and protons and the electrons are outside the atom circling around itSAM · 9 years ago1 0 Comment9. C 19. D (the gang no. is comparable to the no. of valence electrons in each and each factor of that team, different than factors of team 0, that have 2 (helium) or 8 valence electrons each and each) 12. D 13. B (because of the fact the strain of allure between the nucleus and the electrons will strengthen, subsequently the nucleus and electrons replace into closer at the same time) 14. B (that's certainly 'no. of protons and neutrons' – 'no. of protons') 15. Acregar · 1 year ago0 0 CommentThey orbit around in energy shells or levels. Each ""shell"" of electrons has a different capacity of how many electrons it takes until it is full. The first three shells are usually thought of as 2 electrons (when full), 8, then 8. This is misleading but there's a lot of complication about shells that can hold 18, but it depends what educational level of chemistry you're talking about.Miette · 9 years ago1 0 CommentThe electrons are located outside the atom and rotate around its nuculus which is made of protons and Neutrons. Electrons have negative charges Protons have posative Charges Neutrons have no charge. Well in most atoms that is....Natalie Jeans · 9 years ago1 0 Commentelectrons are usually found in the proximity of the electron shells; however, according to the uncertainty law, you can never be sure of an electrons exact psition in an atom. plus btw, did you know that and atoms volume is 98% nothingMonyo T · 9 years ago1 0 Comment1 2 3 nextMaybe you would like to learn more about one of these?Online education an option?
