This means that you are able to plan your own AVON earnings by quickly looking at the table.Remember these earnings are CASH earnings as you keep the representative discount earnings from what your customers have paid you after you have paid AVON.AVON Earnings TableSimply look down the right hand column to work out what you want to earn – and work across to find out how many ordering customers you need. If you want to increase your earnings, simply find more customers.Also, if you want to increase your earnings, why not look at AVON Sales Leadership.

The more brochures you have (and use) the more potential customers and orders you will have.You can also try to increase your average customer spend by perhaps running a promotion or including a newsletter. This will push up your total order value from your existing customers and thus will push up your AVON earnings.Avon Sales Leader avon_representative money salesSuccess TrainingSarah HenshallEarnings | AVON Earnings04.24.2011"
