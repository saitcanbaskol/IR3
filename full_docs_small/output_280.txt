One other thing to remember is that sometime what you are looking at an image and not actual text. Usually the text is pretty evident; you can edit text by clicking on the edit text and images.Lori Kassuba2, 2016-03-02 02, 2016Hi Janina Kowalska,Try making sure the language is set to Polish under File > Properties > Advanced tab in Reading options.Thanks, LoriJanina Kowalska4, 2016-02-18 18, 2016I am unsuccessfully trying to edit Polish text in a pdf file, using Adobe Acrobat XI Pro. The fonts (Bookman Old Style group) are embedded. I would be most grateful for your advice.Kind regards,JaninaLori Kassuba12, 2016-02-12 12, 2016Hi Jackie,This may be possible but it depends on how the PDF was created. Look into the tools located in the Edit PDF tool.Thanks, LoriJackie9, 2016-01-14 14, 2016Hi there. I have got the Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. I have plan that I want to color in only specific blocks/shops….is this possible with this program? Thank you so muchLori Kassuba11, 2015-12-30 30, 2015Hi Lin Kaatz Chary,To release the Add Text tool found in the Editing panel, you can click on the Select tool or Hand tool.Thanks, LoriLin Kaatz Chary2, 2015-12-24 24, 2015You never bothered to answer Rhonda’s question which is my question exactly. I understand how to do edit text using the tools in XI but there is absolutely no intuitive way to turn it off. One “help” answer said click on “OK” but I don’t see an “OK” anywhere. This is beyond annoying. If you could answer this question it would be much appreciated. I click on the “Tool” column on the right, then on “Content Editing” then on “Add text” then add my text but then I can never get out of the “add text” mode. I’m sure there is a very simple obvious solution that I am missing but I am definitely missing it. Please help.Lori Kassuba12, 2015-10-22 22, 2015Hi Appu,Adding comments is different that editing the actual PDF file.

I switch to the Hand tool.Thanks, LoriRhonda5, 2015-10-07 07, 2015How do I actually stop the Edit Text Tool from being active after the change???Lori Kassuba1, 2015-06-29 29, 2015Hi Aurore,Are you able to use this font in any other program?

Any ideas why?

Have you tried this?Thanks, LoriStevie G9, 2015-03-17 17, 2015I have Adobe Acrobat Pro XI and I am trying to edit text (using ‘Edit Text & Images’) in an existing document so that I can insert a registered tradmark symbol (R). Every time I try to do this, it converts it to ‘AE’ and I cannot figure out how to get the symbol inserted properly. Can you please advise? Thank you.Lori Kassuba3, 2015-02-20 20, 2015Hi Dave R.,What command are you using to create the initial text block?Thanks, LoriDave R.10, 2015-02-20 20, 2015When I create a text block, then save it, the next time I open the document it breaks the single text block into several smaller ones. Is there a way to prevent this? (12 lines of text, all very short).Lori Kassuba1, 2015-02-11 11, 2015Hi Keith,Unfortunately, there isn’t an easy way to reorganize the pieces once you flatten and attempt to edit the PDF. When you activate the editor it looks for nearby text and creates a bounding box. You might try seeing the moving the placement of the text in the Content Navigation pane changes this behavior.Thanks, LoriKeith3, 2015-02-04 04, 2015Attempting to edit flattened PDFs - specifically a text area where Acrobat combined a pre-filled name value, line with text beneath. Any attempt to edit any portion of these three text pieces re-organizes the entire layout. Do we have any controls on joining (or breaking up) text areas?Lori Kassuba2, 2015-02-03 03, 2015Hi Bobby,Yes, you can edit text in Acrobat Standard. However, the editing capability was much more limited in earlier versions (i.e., Acrobat X).Thanks, LoriBobby10, 2015-02-01 01, 2015Can you edit PDF documents with Adobe Standard. It seems like you can address pictorial issues, but not too regular editing.Lori Kassuba10, 2014-11-20 20, 2014Hi JuanM,Feel free to post your editing suggestion here: https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=wishformWhen I use Ctrl + 0 it fits to the page. What version are you running?Thanks, LoriJuanM4, 2014-11-19 19, 2014Hello Lori, Well yes, I’ve tried the Add Text command but I would have to position manually each text in each page, which for the job I’m doing is not an option. Being that the case, is better to use the Header/Footer command, edit the piece of text and reposition manually. I guess that’s some functionality that is to come (though it was possible in past versions). I really hope Acrobat will recover that simple task, and many others (e.g. shortcut customization, or Ctrl+0 to fit one full page in window instead of zooming-in)... But anyway, thanks a lot for your interest, Lori. JuanMLori Kassuba10, 2014-11-17 17, 2014Hi JuanM,Have you tried using the Add Text command instead of the Edit Text & Images command? It doesn’t seem to affect the layout and is easier than the Header/Footer command.Thanks, LoriJuanM2, 2014-11-14 14, 2014Thanks a lot for you answer Lori. Effectively I’ve been using the Update Header/Footer, but unfortunately there’s no way to apply to the current page without specifying a Page range (from 10 to 10), and I there’s one part of the header I have to change in each page, so having to set a range for each page is quite time consuming. I have even considered scripting the Header/Footer command, but apparently it can only be done with Page Watermark OCG’s, and it would be even more harder to set it differently for each page. I really wonder why Adobe didn’t include the Selected pages and Current page option in the Header/Footer settings dialog. Thanks again, Lori, you’ve been very kind. Regards, JuanMLori Kassuba2, 2014-11-14 14, 2014Hi JuanM,Thanks for the example. I think this is occurring because the Header/Footer command using Optional Content Groups (OCGs) and not just regular text. As a workaround you could use the Update Header/Footer command to add the new text and just apply it to the current page.Let us know if this helps, LoriJuanM5, 2014-11-12 12, 2014I guess that the change Adobe did by switching off the “Edit Document Text” for the one-tool-only “Edit Text & Images” messed this functionality… unless I’m doing it the wrong way…JuanM4, 2014-11-12 12, 2014Sure, Lori. I’ve just made an example in screen captured PDF (http://we.tl/tx3eYQbDNs), adding a header text aligned to top of page, and then, trying to edit that text, acrobat pulls it down, forcing the text box inside the art box. In past versions of Acrobat (X pro) this did not happen, you could edit header texts without modifying layout. Thanks!Lori Kassuba3, 2014-11-12 12, 2014Hi JuanM,Can you forward a link to an example of this behavior?Thanks, LoriJuanM5, 2014-11-10 10, 2014Hello, I’ve been trying to edit text that has been added with Header command. I first add a prefix text by using headers to a big range of pages, then, page page I add a name to each prefix. The problem is that the text is almost touching the top of the page, so when I add the text Acrobat moves the text box down and changes the composition. Is there a way to prevent this? back in version X this didn’t happen. Thanks in advance.Lori Kassuba12, 2014-09-12 12, 2014Hi balan,You’ll need Acrobat (not the free Reader) to do this. Start by activating Edit mode by selecting the Edit Text & Images command in the Content Editing panel. Then, you’ll see bounding boxes around the text paragraphs. Click your cursor in the first line and press the space bar.Thanks, LoriLori Kassuba12, 2014-09-12 12, 2014David Bulman,You can use the Add Header & Footer command found under the Tools Pane > Pages panel in Acrobat to remove an existing header or add a blank one that covers up the sequential numbering.Thanks, LoriJoan Jones10, 2014-09-12 12, 2014Thank you, Patty!Patty Friesen10, 2014-09-12 12, 2014Hi Joan,Alternatively, you can view the same content as an infographic by going to: http://acrobatusers.com/tutorials/how-to-edit-text-in-a-pdf-file-infographicPattyPatty Friesen10, 2014-09-12 12, 2014Hi Joan,Directly under the video text is a link to ‘view transcript.’ That will give you a text version of the content presented in the video.Hope this helps.PattyJoan Jones10, 2014-09-12 12, 2014Is there any way I could get a written text instead of this video tutorial?

How can I delete the header and all the sequential page numbers on each page?Mike9, 2014-07-30 30, 2014I use Adobe Reader at work to revise scanned electrical schematics. IT dept.has “upgraded” the Pro versions several times and the learning process starts over each time. Not all changes are for the better. To the old Pro 9 users…Do not try to create a text box with ‘Text Box’ tool, because you can’t edit the text appearance afterwards (like you could on older versions. As the video shows- create a text boxes using the “Add Text” tool. Editing text in this newly created box will be easy then. Thanks for all the tips Donna. They enlightened me, MikeLori Kassuba2, 2014-07-28 28, 2014Hi Gary Cosel,In Forms Edit mode, open the Fields pane and select all your Text Fields. Next, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + i to bring up the Properties and change the default font. This will change the default font for all the fields that you selected.Thanks, LoriGary Cosel2, 2014-07-26 26, 2014I converted one of my treatment forms into a pdf document file. Then I made it into a template and created text fields to type into. My problem now - how do I change the font and font size of the text that I want to type into the text field? - it is stuck in default at “12”.Lori Kassuba1, 2014-05-27 27, 2014Hi Ellen Campion,You’ll need Acrobat Std. or Pro. to modify form fields.

However, you can use the Add Text Comment tool in the Comment pane in the free Reader to add larger text to your PDF file. This tool allows you to place your cursor anywhere in the PDF and add text (provided the PDF has not been secured to disallow this).i have used this tool to edit various pdf tax documents.Thanks, DefensetaxWatz3, 2014-04-25 25, 2014... how can I see the Video withOut flash!Lori Kassuba10, 2014-04-17 17, 2014Hi Melissa,For future reference if you use the steps mentioned in this tutorial, you’ll be able to edit a PDF file that originated as a scanned image. http://acrobatusers.com/tutorials/how-to-edit-a-scanned-pdf-fileAt this point, since the information is an image and not real text you can use the Edit Using dropdown in the Content Editing panel to launch an external program (if you have one installed on your system like Photoshop or MS Paint) to make your changes there.Thanks, LoriMelissa9, 2014-04-16 16, 2014Hi Lori,Yes, it did originiated as a scanned image, it was a PDF. It will only allow me to edit certain parts of the document, not the entire thing. Any advice?Lori Kassuba11, 2014-04-14 14, 2014Hi Melissa,Did this particular document originate as a scanned image? Anything else unusual about it?Thanks, LoriMelissa2, 2014-04-11 11, 2014For some reason, I am not able to edit a document. Upon clicking the edit button on the right hand side, it will only allow me to edit certain parts of the document, not all of it. i have never had this happen before, can you please help?Thank youLori Kassuba1, 2014-04-01 01, 2014Hi Amy,I see that Karl responded to your question here: http://answers.acrobatusers.com/how-I-names-numbers-chapters-page-original-doc-q151522.aspxIf you’re still having problems, can you respond to his question so we can help you get your novel published:) Good luck!LoriAmy1, 2014-03-24 24, 2014The piece of work I consult your page about is a novel; I must send a copy by email to Europe. They requested a .pdf what never happened to me before. And my problem is all chapters (and numbers) were on a NEW page in the original Word .doc and my .pdf shows it all rushing straightaway which is the absolute wrong idea for a novel. I have very little experience with Acrobat but a lot with these people and I fear being refused after 8 months of hard work. I’d be so very grateful if your are able to give me a hint to help me out. I’d be grateful even if you are overworked and can’t. Kindest regards from Amy.Lori Kassuba10, 2014-03-20 20, 2014Hi maria,It sounds as though you have the text form field font properties set to auto. This is will create the variance in font sizing. I would change it to an exact size similar to the text surrounding the form field.Thanks, Lorimaria4, 2014-03-17 17, 2014Thanks for your advice. The situation is that I’ve converted a word doc. into a PDF. Some areas in the documents needs to be filled by others. The whole doc. is a PDF except the areas where additional information needs to be included. The thing here is that when running a sample I notice that font size changes while writing. I have a Adobe XI Pro, I’m new with the program and need to solve this issue. Appreciate your comments.Lori Kassuba10, 2014-03-10 10, 2014Hi Maria,Are you saying that you want to allow folks to add information in the highlighted areas? If so, I would place text form fields on the PDF using the tools located under the Tools pane > Forms panel in Acrobat Std. or Pro. version XI.Thanks, LoriMaria4, 2014-03-04 04, 2014I have already converted a Word doc into a PDF. There are highlighted spaces that needs to be modified. What do I have to do for only allowing modifications in the highlighted areas? Thanks in advance.Lori Kassuba10, 2014-02-27 27, 2014Hi Bruce Andrews,If your form does not have any existing form fields on it, the best way to fill it out would be to use the Add Text Comment command located under the Comment pane in Reader XI (not earlier version of Reader). Or, you can also use the tools found under the Sign pane to add text, checkmarks, and initials.Thanks, LoriLori Kassuba10, 2014-02-27 27, 2014Hi K.D.G,As Toni mentions, all you need to do to reset your panels is to select the Customize dropdown (located in the top right corner) and choose Default tools.Thanks, LoriBruce Andrews2, 2014-02-26 26, 2014I received a Adobe form and can’t fill it out on my pc. how do I convert so I can fill it out.

G1, 2014-01-28 28, 2014Has adobe “updated” Acrobat Pro XI?? All my tools have changed. I don’t have that side panel anymore with all of the options. It just suddenly changed or erased with the most recent update. (adobe acrobat automatically updates). I had to go in the “Custom” button, and add all of those buttons back, to the tool bar above at the top of the screen. But I still seem to be missing editing tools. For example the ones that are shown in the video tutorial above—I don’t have those anymore.Harry Hemus8, 2014-01-09 09, 2014Hi LoriI’ve just spotted this thread which seems more focused on the editing text and images tool within XI and not X.So I just wanted to pursue the original question I posed.Is it possible to use the new tool for editing multiple layered documents.Here is the link again to ONE page from a much larger projecthttps://www.dropbox.com/s/dihxnucbeekf68w/Multi_Layer_Edit_Test_for_Lori.pdfLori Kassuba2, 2014-01-02 02, 2014Hi Rick H.,This depends on the program used to create the PDF. Is it Word?

A little help please.Lori Kassuba3, 2013-12-26 26, 2013Hi Mitchell,Acrobat XI Pro. also comes with a form design tool called Formscentral that you can use to easily create brand new forms as well.Thanks, LoriMitchell4, 2013-12-19 19, 2013My problem turned out to be that I was doing all my designing directly in Adobe Acrobat instead of first utilizing a preliminary means of designing my form (I ended up using Microsoft Word). Once I had the form layout all setup then I converted it to Adobe pdf and added the form fields I desired.I’m guessing that my initial attempt at designing the form left a bunch of “hidden” containers (visible if I looked at content view). Those “hidden” containers at times may have come to the foreground covering the text beneath it.Lori Kassuba3, 2013-12-19 19, 2013Hi Mitchell,Are you using a Mac? If so, make sure you’re not working with the form in Mac Preview.

However, you are restricted in the type and extent of editing possible based on your program version. For example, in Acrobat 9 you don’t have access to the editing tools and features that are shown in the video. You can make changes using the TouchUp Text editing tool.donna.Yvette Dingwall12, 2013-08-26 26, 2013I created a document in Acrobat Pro 9 and now need to make changes.

I cannot edit the text in the PDF using Acrobat Pro XI.donna baker10, 2013-08-06 06, 2013Hi Gretchen -Use the Edit Text & Images tool. When you select it, the frames on the page show around paragraphs and images, etc. With the tool, select the frame containing the text you want to change, and made the settings changes in the Tools panel.donna.Alfred11, 2013-08-03 03, 2013Actually I’m working with two software Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop from Adobe Creative Cloud and I pay each month for both trough HSBC bank but since August 15 must pay trough National Bank of Mexico (BANAMEX) and my question is what can I do with you to continue paying through this bank?Many thanks AlfredGretchen2, 2013-07-30 30, 2013I want to change the font size in the text box but cannot figure out how to do it.donna baker1, 2013-06-26 26, 2013Hi Johanna -You’re not going to get the same level of control with Reader that you would with Acrobat. From your description, it sounds like the Word spacing was set in the program, and not by using a specific font. For that reason, when you copy and paste, the features don’t convert and you’ll have the basic fonts again, probably using default substitute fonts in Reader.donna.Johanna11, 2013-06-25 25, 2013Hello!I have Adobe Reader XI and I’m trying to copy and paste a letter from Word to PDF. I scanned the letterhead and I’m adding the content; however, when I’m about to print, it automatically changes the spacing - it collapse. It seems that it converts it to a box. Is there a way to change this?Thank you!Johannadonna baker1, 2013-06-18 18, 2013Hi Livleen -You can select each paragraph in the document with the Edit Text and Images tool, then change the font. That will work, but takes a fair bit of time. If possible, it’s simplest to get the source document, change the font there, and then recreate the PDF file.donna.livleen singh10, 2013-06-16 16, 2013How to edit pdf document with a different font - Anandpur sahib and then save it. ThanksLivleendonna baker12, 2013-06-04 04, 2013Hi Gia -You remove the password from the Properties dialog box. Choose File > Properties to open the dialog box, and click the Security tab. You’ll see fields to remove your password. Save it after you finish removing the password. You definitely don’t have to start over again.donna.donna baker12, 2013-06-04 04, 2013Hi Alan -Is the date displayed in a field? If so, open the field properties, and click the Format tab. Change the format to text and you should be fine.It almost sounds like there’s an issue with your program overall, though. If you’re on Windows, choose Help > Repair Acrobat Installation and let the program go through its installed components and fix anything that’s required.donna.Gia8, 2013-06-04 04, 2013How do I edit pdf which I created and password protected..? I need to edit it and I cannot find anywhere a place to write my password and open the document for editing. Or do I really need to re-create this document from the beginning to be able to edit it ?Alan Wickstrom11, 2013-05-31 31, 2013I have a document that needs to be updated every year, so I went into last year’s pdf using acrobat XI and made all the changes. One of the changes is changing the year from 2012-13 to 2013-14. So, I did that and after I saved it, I opened the document back up and it says 2015-16. I changed it again and the same thing happened. So, then I just deleted it and typed in the entire year and century instead of just changing the year. I saved it and now it reads 4235/36. Why is this happening and what do I need to do to change it. Obviously, it has something to do with them being numerals.Patty Friesen10, 2013-05-31 31, 2013Hi Sabrina,Here is a pretty comprehensive tutorial on editing text using Acrobat 9.
