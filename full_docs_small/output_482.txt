Structure and Function of the Cells of the Immune System Ana Christiana Joy M. Arroyo BMLS 3-A July 20,20122. LYMPHOCYTES Small white blood cells which are responsible for much of the work of the Immune System. Lymphocytes can be divided into three classes: B cells, T cells and Natural Killer cells (NKC) . Mature lymphocytes all have a similar appearance. They are small cells with a deeply basophilic nucleus and scanty cytoplasm.3. B Cells and T Cells Also known as B cell lymphocytes and T cell lymphocytes. T cells or T lymphocytes belong to a group of white blood cells and play a central role in Cell-mediated Immunity. While, B cells are lymphocytes that play a large role in the Humoral Immune Response. B cells is an essential component of the Adaptive Immune System. B cells spend their entire early life in the bone marrow. While the T cells, leave the bone marrow at an early age and travel to the thymus, where they mature.4.  The principal functions of B cells is to make antibodies against antigens, perform the role of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and eventually develop into memory B cells after activation by antigen interaction. On the other hand, T cells constitutes 65-75% of blood lymphocytes. They can be distinguished from other lymphocytes by the presence of a T cell receptor (TCR) on the cell surface. Another key feature of B cells and T cells, includes the receptors it has in its surface. T cells recognize a linear sequence of amino acids whereas, B cells the spatial arrangement of proteins, nucleic acids, polyssacharides or lipids.5. Helper T-Cell: assist other white blood cells in immunologicprocesses, including maturation of B cells into plasmacells and memory B cells, and activation of cytotoxic T cellsand macrophages.Cytotoxic T-Cell: destroy virally infected cells and tumorcells, and are also implicated in transplant rejection.Regulatory T-Cell: formerly known as suppressor Tcells, are crucial for the maintenance of immunologicaltolerance.Memory T-Cell: are a subset of antigen-specific T cells thatpersist long-term after an infection has resolved.6. Plasma B-Cells: are large B cells that have beenexposed to antigen and produce and secrete largeamounts of antibodies, which assist in the destructionof microbes by binding to them and making themeasier targets for phagocytes and activation ofthe complement system.Memory B-Cells: are formed from activated B cellsthat are specific to the antigen encountered during theprimary immune response.B1 Cells and B2 CellsMarginal B-CellsFollicular B-Cells7. Natural Killer Cells These cells lack the marker molecules characteristic of B and T cells. They comprise about 10-15% of the lymphocytes of circulating blood. The role NK cells play is analogous to that of cytotoxic T cells in the vertebrate adaptive immune response. NK cells provide rapid responses to virally infected cells and respond to tumor formation, acting at around 3 days after infection.8.  NK cells are unique, however, as they have the ability to recognize stressed cells in the absence of antibodies and MHC, allowing for a much faster immune reaction. They were named “natural killers” because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are missing “self” markers of major histocompatibility complex (MHC).9. ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELLS These are group of diverse cell types that assists other cells in the Immune Response. Cells which do not have antigen-specific receptors. Instead, they capture and process antigens, present them to T cell receptors. These cells include Macrophages, B Cells and Dentritic cells.10. DENDRITIC CELL These cells are immune cells forming part of the Mammalian Immune System. Their main function is to process antigen material and present it on the surface to other cells of the immune system. They act as messengers between the innate and adaptive immunity.11.  At certain development stages they grow branched projections, the dendrites. While similar in appearance, these are distinct structures from the dendrites of neurons. Immature dendritic cells are also called veiled cells, as they possess large cytoplasmic “veils” rather than dendrites.12.  Dendritic cells are present in tissues in contact with the external environment, such as the skin and the inner lining of the nose, lungs, stomach and intestines. They can also be found in an immature state in the blood. Once activated, they migrate to the lymph nodes where they interact with T cells and B cells to initiate and shape the adaptive immune response.13. MACROPHAGES Macrophages are cells produced by the differentiation of monocytes in tissues. It function in both non-specific defense, Innate Immunity, as well as help initiate specific defense mechanisms, Adaptive Immunity, of vertebrate animals. Their role is to ”phagocytose” (engulf and then digest) cellular debris and pathogens, either as stationary or as mobile cells. They also stimulate lymphocytes and other immune cells to respond to pathogens. They are specialized phagocytic cells that attack foreign substances, infectious microbes and cancer cells through destruction and ingestion.14. MONOCYTE Monocytes are type of white blood cell and are part of the Innate Immune System of vertebrates including all mammals. Monocytes play multiple roles in immune function. Such roles include: (1) replenish resident macrophages and dendritic cells under normal states. (2) in response to inflammation signals, monocytes can move quickly (approx. 8-12 hours) to sites of infection in the tissues and divide into macrophages and dendritic cells to elicit an immune response.15. PLASMA CELL Plasma cells, also called plasma B cells, plasmocytes, and effector B cells, are white blood cells which produce large volumes of antibodies. They are transported by the blood plasma and the lymphatic system. They have basophilic cytoplasm and an eccentric nucleus with heterochromatin in a characteristic cartwheel or clock face arrangement. Most of these die after four to five days; however, a few survive to become memory cells.16. MAST CELLS These are cells concentrated within the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and within the deep layers of the skin. These cells release histamine upon encountering certain antigens, thereby triggering an allergic reaction. The mast cell is very similar in both appearance and function to the Basophil, a type of white blood cell.17. MEGAKARYOCYTE It is a bone marrow cell responsible for the production of blood thrombocytes (platelets), which are necessary for normal blood clotting. Megakaryocytes are 10 to 15 times larger than a typical red blood cell, averaging 50-100 μm in diameter.18. RED BLOOD CELL It is also called “Erythrocytes” and has two functions: 1.) To pick up oxygen from the lungs and deliver it to tissues elsewhere. 2.) To pick up carbon dioxide from other tissues and unload it in the lungs. An erythrocyte is a disc-shaped cell with a thick rim and a thin sunken centre. RBCs are incapable of aerobic respiration, preventing them from consuming the oxygen they transport because they lose nearly all their inner cellular components during maturation.19. WHITE BLOOD CELL White blood cells are also known as leukocytes. They can be divided into granulocytes and agranulocytes. The former have cytoplasms that contain organelles that appear as coloured granules through light microscopy, hence their name. Granulocytes consist of neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. In contrast, agranulocytes do not contain granules. They consist of lymphocytes and monocytes.20. NEUTROPHILS These cells are the most abundant type of white blood cells in mammals and form an essential part of the innate immune system. In general, they are referred to as either neutrophils or polymorphonuclear neutrophils, and are subdivided into segmented neutrophils and banded neutrophils.21.  Neutrophils are normally found in the blood stream. During the beginning (acute) phase of inflammation, particularly as a result of bacterial infection, environmental exposure, and some cancers. They are the predominant cells in pus, accounting for its whitish/yellowish appearance. Neutrophils are recruited to the site of injury within minutes following trauma and are the hallmark of acute inflammation.22. EOSINOPHILS These cells are white blood cells that are one of the immune system components responsible for combating multicellular parasites and certain infections in vertebrates. Along with mast cells, they also control mechanisms associated with allergy and asthma. They are granulocytes that develop during hematopoiesis in the bone marrow before migrating into blood.23. BASOPHIL The name comes from the fact that these leukocytes are basophilic; they are susceptible to staining by basic dyes. Basophils contain large cytoplasmic granules which obscure the cell nucleus under the microscope. However, when unstained, the nucleus is visible and it usually has 2 lobes.24. PLATELET Platelets are small fragments of bone marrow cells and are therefore not really classified as cells themselves. Platelets have the following functions: Secrete vasoconstrictors which constrict blood vessels, causing vascular spasms in broken blood vessels, Form temporary platelet plugs to stop bleeding, Secrete procoagulants (clotting factors) to promote blood clotting, Dissolve blood clots when they are no longer needed, Digest and destroy bacteria, Secrete chemicals that attract neutrophils and monocytes to sites of inflammation and Secrete growth factors to maintain the linings of blood vessels."
