He falters during a rap battle one night at a local venue, the Shelter, and he leaves the stage humiliated.Jimmy works at a car factory. When he asks for extra shifts, his supervisor laughs and dismisses his request on account of his habitual lateness. Jimmy befriends a woman named Alex. Over time, Jimmy begins to take more responsibility for the direction of his life. When he exhibits an improved attitude and performance at work, his supervisor grants him the extra shifts he requested.Stephanie receives a notice evicting her and the family as she cannot pay rent. Despite Stephanie's best attempts to keep the eviction notice a secret, Greg finds out about it. A fight ensues between him and Jimmy, and Greg leaves Stephanie for good. Jimmy's friendship with Wink, a radio DJ with ties to a record label promoter, becomes strained after he discovers that Wink does promotional work for Jimmy's rivals, a rap group known as the ""Leaders of the Free World.""

In retaliation, Wink and the Leaders of the Free World assault Jimmy outside his mother's trailer. The leader of the gang, Papa Doc, holds Jimmy at gunpoint, threatening to kill him before being dissuaded by Wink.Jimmy's best friend and battle host, Future, pushes him to get revenge by competing against the Leaders of the Free World at the next rap battle. However, Jimmy's late-night shift conflicts with the timing of the next battle tournament. A goodbye visit from Alex, who is moving to New York, changes his mind about competing, and Paul agrees to cover his shift at work as a favor while Jimmy goes to the battle.In all rounds of the rap battle, Jimmy has to compete against one member of ""the Leaders."" After winning the first two rounds, he has to challenge Papa Doc. He wins by exposing his opponent's weaknesses as well as his own. With nothing to say in rebuttal, Papa Doc hands the microphone back to Future, embarrassed. After being congratulated by Alex and his friends, Jimmy is offered a position by Future, hosting battles at The Shelter. Jimmy declines, saying he has to get back to work and to find success his own way.Cast  [ edit]Eminem as Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith, Jr.Mekhi Phifer as Future, Jimmy's closest friend and the rap battle hostBrittany Murphy as Alex Latourno, Jimmy's love interestKim Basinger as Stephanie, Jimmy and Lily's motherAnthony Mackie as Papa DocMichael Shannon as Greg Buehl, Stephanie's boyfriendEugene Byrd as WinkEvan Jones as Cheddar Bob, Jimmy's friendOmar Benson Miller as Sol George, Jimmy's friend and Iz's brotherDe'Angelo Wilson as DJ Iz, Jimmy's friend and Sol's brotherTaryn Manning as Janeane, Jimmy's ex-girlfriendProof as Lil' TicXzibit as Mike (Male Lunch Truck Rapper)Craig Chandler as PaulObie Trice as Male parking lot rapperChloe Greenfield as Lily, Jimmy's sisterJohn Singleton as BouncerMiz Korona as Vanessa (Female Lunch Truck Rapper)Brandon T.
