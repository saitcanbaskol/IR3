"Here are some tips on how to make adjustments for convection oven cooking times. Print out our handy chart of adjusted temperatures and cooking times for specific foods like your Thanksgiving turkey, baking cookies, cakes and pastries. These tips will help you transition from regular to convection cooking.Browse More In Select... selectArticle By: Barbara BowmanEmailPrintPublished by: Gourmet SleuthLast Updated: 04/07/2018General Convection Oven Recipe Conversion GuidelinesThere are three commonly accepted methods of converting recipes from conventional oven baking to convection oven baking.Bake at the same conventional oven temperature but for a shorter period of time.Bake for the same length of time as you would using a conventional oven but reduce the temperature by 25 degrees.Bake for a slightly shorter period of time and a reduced temperature. This tends to be the most successful method for most ovens.When Should Convection Cooking Be Used Rather Than Conventional CookingFoods cooked in a convection oven cook about 25% - 30% faster than a conventional oven as the hot air is forced around the food. Foods tend to have less moisture loss and fewer nutrients are destroyed in the cooking process.One of the most important factors when determining which cooking method is most appropriate for your food is the type of dish or pan you are cooking in. If the cooking container blocks the flow of air around the food then there is no use in using convection cooking.Convection Cooking Is Good ForCookie sheetsShallow pansConvential Cooking Is Good ForCovered casseroles, pans or dishesDeep roasting pansMore Convection Cooking TipsManufacturer Guidelines Follow the recommendations from the manufacturer of the oven. Your oven typically shipped with a user guide. It is a good idea to familiarized yourself with the specifics for your own oven. If you don't have a user manual then try contacting the manufacture to obtain a copy. Many provide printable copies online. Air Circulation Air circulation is important. Don't cover racks with foil. Allow 1 to 1 1/2 inches around pans (also above and below pans for multi-rack baking). Use Proper Pans For maximum browning, use pans with low sides, and rimless cookie sheets. Many ovens come with special pans and racks that lift roasts so air flows all around. If possible, place the long sides of the pan parallel to the oven door.Roasting GuidelinesRoast meats and poultry Preheating is not necessary. Place meats on a rack in the roasting pan for better browning. Roasting time may be 20 to 30 percent less than in a conventional oven if temperatures aren't reduced. Some ovens offer a special roasting mode that provides top and/or bottom browning or an initial surge in heat in addition to the fan. These modes make it easy to get optimum results in a shorter time. Small Roasts or Unstuffed Poultry Do not reduce oven temperatures for small pieces, skinny roasts, or unstuffed poultry. In our tests, we roasted a 3 1/2-pound chicken at 375 |degrees~. In about an hour, about 20 percent less time than for conventional cooking, it was beautifully browned, with succulent flesh. Dense Roasts & Stuffed Turkeys For large, dense roasts and big stuffed turkeys, you may need to reduce the temperature 25 |degrees~ during part or all of the roasting time. When you lower the temperature, the meat may be juicier and shrink less, but it will take longer to cook.Convection Cooking ChartsMethod 1: Reduce temp by 25 to 30 degrees and bake per conventional recipe timeConventional Oven Temp Convection Less 25F Convection Less 30F225 200 195250 225 220275 250 245300 275 270325 300 295350 325 320375 350 345400 375 370425 400 395450 425 420475 450 445500 475 470525 500 495550 525 520Method 2: Bake at conventional oven temperature but reduce cooking time by 25%-30% lessConventional Baking Time In minutes 25% Less Time 30% Less Time10 8 715 11 10.520 15 1425 19 17.530 23 2135 26 24.540 30 2845 34 31.550 38 3555 41 38.560 45 4265 49 45.570 53 4975 56 52.580 60 5685 64 59.590 68 6395 71 66.5100 75 70105 79 73.5110 83 77115 86 80.5120 90 84125 94 87.5130 98 91135 101 94.5140 105 98145 109 101.5150 113 105"
