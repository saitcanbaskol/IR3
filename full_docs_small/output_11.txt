"Shutterstock.com / wavebreakmediaIf you want your cable company, airline or pretty much any other company to resolve your complaints quickly and completely, you may need to change the way you deal with customer service.According to the latest data from the American Customer Service Index, Americans are increasingly dissatisfied with the companies they deal with. In the first quarter of 2014, overall customer satisfaction scores across all industries fell to 76.2 out of 100, which the researchers who compile the ratings say was “one of the largest [drops] in the 20-year history of the Index.” And some industries are particularly hated: Internet (63 out of 100) and cable and subscription TV (65) companies and airlines (69) rank at the bottom when it comes to customer satisfaction.Part of the dissatisfaction may be because we are interacting with customer service the wrong way. A report released Wednesday by customer-service software firm Zendesk, which looked at customer-service interactions from more than 25,000 companies across 140 countries, as well as insight from customer-service experts, found that some consumers are acting in ways that aren’t yielding them good results.Here are four strategies to employ when dealing with customer service.Don’t be too sternBeing “overbearing” or “overly stern” is “a common strategy for some customers seeking better service,” the Zendesk survey revealed. “However, the data indicates that customers who are polite tend to submit higher customer satisfaction scores than those who aren’t.” Indeed, customers who ask the customer service rep to “please” help them with their request, and who said “thank you” for help they received throughout the call reported that they got better customer service than those who did not use these words, the survey showed.Of course, it could be that people who use these words tend to be more satisfied anyway. But there’s a strong chance that saying these platitudes ingratiates the customer service rep to you -- making them more willing to help you quickly and kindly with your request, experts say. “If you can find any excuse at all to praise them and build them up -- ‘you’re very good at what you do,’ ‘I really appreciate the extra effort,’ — people will almost always bend over backwards to maintain that good opinion and to show you just how good they really are,” says Barry Maher, the author of “Filling the Glass,” which focuses in part on getting better customer service and on personal empowerment. “Treat people well who aren’t used to being treated well…and you may well be astonished by the results you get.” Chip Bell, the founder of business consulting firm Chip Bell Group and author of “The 9 1/2 Principles of Innovative Service” adds that “you don’t have to be from the South to show respect with a liberal amount of ‘sir’ and ‘ma’am — it will open doors otherwise closed.”At the very least, “don’t go in guns a’ blazing,” says Shep Hyken, author of “Amaze Every Customer Every Time.” “The moment you lose your cool is the moment you lose control.” And, if that kindness does not work — rather than starting to get nasty — simply ask to speak to a higher authority, says Maher.Take notesTake a lesson from Rich Davis, the Comcast customer who recorded his call with the company and saw it go viral: It often pays to have good records of the antics a company is up to if you want to get your way down the road. “Have you ever heard a recording when you call for assistance that stated, ‘be advised this call may be recorded for quality assurance,’?” says motivational coach and speaker Chantay Bridges. “Flip the script, let the rep know: you are documenting them and keeping a record, that their service is also being noted.” While few customers keep detailed notes or recordings of their interactions, experts say, this will help them should there be a problem down the road, as they’ll have proof of what went on.Don’t keep your problems to yourselfMost customers know that they should contact customer service via multiple channels like phone, email and social media to get their complaint resolved ASAP. But few take the logical next step: contacting competitors via these channels too to explain how their current company is not serving their needs. “If you receive a response from a competitor, watch or ask for a counter from the business you originally were contacting,” says John Huehn, CEO of In the Chat, which provides social media and text messaging platforms to enhance customer service. This could provide you with the leverage you need to get your issue resolved.It’s OK to keep it briefWhen it comes to email complaints, longer isn’t better, so don’t waste your breath (you might, after all, need that energy for dealing with the company later on). While experts often advise consumers to give customer service reps as many details as possible so they can effectively fix the customer’s complaint, customers who wrote long emails didn’t report getting any better customer service than those who wrote short ones, the Zendesk survey revealed. Indeed, the customer’s satisfaction levels at the end of the exchange were roughly the same whether they wrote 50 words or 200 words. Jason Maynard, product manager and data science lead at Zendesk, says that this doesn’t mean you should not include detail (indeed, that helps) but that you should make this detail as succinct as possible; if you have a complicated problem or request, you may want to consider calling, as most of us aren’t trained as technical writers."
