"General discussionWhat should be backed up?by billcanada /  October 22, 2006 6:47 AM PDTI've been doing full backups of my hard drive to an external hard drive. I was wondering if that is the optimal way to do it? What files need to be archived in case of hard drive failure on a windows machine? Thanks.

I have only been backing up the whole disc at a time. I had the same thought about not backing up the programs that I have the discs for. Should I back up the Windows folder especially? I understand that over time Windows will get wonky at which point the hard drive should be wiped and everything re-installed. Should I take periodic backups of specific Windows folders or files or is that not much of a problem anymore? Thanks again.

I've seen it happen.. As a result, it's the reason I make hard-copy backups of the important documents, picture, music, and other files that I can't afford to use.. I burn a backup of the backup to a CD or DVD. Acronis is a great tool but using another hard drive to backup the primary drive only helps if the second wasn't isn't dead when you try to access it. It's your choice. Hope this helps.

Bookmarks, emails and addresses, pictures, documents, etc. Everything else can be reinstalled. And because I can be a little paranoid, I back up everything once a week to an external HD, then that image is burned to a DVD. I can't imagine loosing both devices. As far as reloading Windows every so often, I've never had to. I've found that the people who have to reinstall everything are lousy surfers, try to install something that won't work, are lax in running AV and spyware programs, and usually just plain too lazy to take care of their machine.Flag Permalink This was helpful ( 0)Collapse - Quick online backupby k4kyv /  October 27, 2006 3:27 AM PDTIn reply to: Agree. . .In addition to an external hard drive, for something I want to make sure I don't lose, I create a folder on the desktop and name it appropriately. Then I copy the files I want to back up into the folder. Then I send an e-mail message to myself, using one of the free web-based email services, and attach the backup folder. I use Hotmail, but others are available, such as Yahoo and MyWay. In my e-mail account I have created a folder titled ''backups'' and archive the back-up messages there. Just remember there is a storage limit on the free accounts, and make sure your backup file isn't too large. I don't use this method for a general backup, but just for particular files for which I want an additional layer of protection against loss. If I eventually no longer need the backed up file, I promptly delete it to save storage space in the e-mail account.Flag Permalink This was helpful ( 0)Collapse - I Like Itby dcmorris /  October 28, 2006 10:29 PM PDTIn reply to: Quick online backupWhy didn't I think of that! I do not rely heavily on my PC but I have a few files ,such as photos, which I would not want to lose. Gmail has plenty of storage so I am taking your advice, k4kyy, and will send myself aan e-mail as I update and/or add to files. I realize this method would not work for those with large storage demands but it fits my needs. Thanks for the tip.

In your case, an external drive may be your only inexpensive source unless you want to purchase a separate internal drive to store things on. (There are web storage locations but usually they're more expensive in the long run.) But remember, sooner or later, ANY hard drive can die.. If the mail is extremely important to you, make backups of your backups. Hope this helps.

For small amounts of data that is okay and I have done that for a few things. Since I am paranoid about losing things on my hard drive from drive failure or viruses I have built in too much redundancy, I'm afraid. I have 3 internal drives and 3 external drives. Not all have the same info. I started out with CD's but soon realized that this was too resrictive because data in any file might change and I would end up with too many CD's. I have been leary of using DVD's because I have heard that they are much more subject to damage than CD's, ie, that flexing is very hard on them. Sometimes when I take my CD's out of their jewel case they almost bend in half and I am sure that a DVD will not stand up to that kind of abuse.Flag Permalink This was helpful ( 0)Collapse - Dics too flexibleby forkboy1965 /  January 10, 2007 8:26 AM PSTIn reply to: Not just mail.M, Consider ditching those plastic jewel cases and buy a binder with CD/DVD inserts. A binder that will hold 200-discs can be had at any local big name all-purpose retailer for under $30. I keep all mine in one as it takes up FAR less space and is much easier on the media.Flag Permalink This was helpful ( 0)Collapse - If the data/info is important, why...by Edward ODaniel /  January 13, 2007 9:09 AM PSTIn reply to:  (NT) Any free email site have a large capacity?count on ""free""?

That's quite true. Software installs/uninstalls, downloads, etc. take their toll on a Windows installation. Continuing to backup the entire C: drive at that point just means you'll be preserving the very things that you'd like to get rid of. So, here's what I did: I wiped my hard drive and reinstalled Windows, as well as all my application software. After updating Windows and my apps (I have downloaded almost all the patches to Windows and other programs that I'll need), moving all my previously backed up data and media files, downloaded files (mostly shareware/freeware programs) as well as browser bookmarks to where they were and tweaking my settings to where I want them for all 3 users of this PC, I then burned an image of the hard drive to DVDs - and made a copy of that image. Now, all I do is use Norton Ghost to make a base backup of the Documents and Settings folder as well as my downloaded files. I use Mozilla, so I use the freeware MozBackup utility for browser settings. Periodically, I'll burn that backup to CD - again, twice. One copy of these CDs/DVDs is here at home, the other is at my workplace. If disaster strikes, all I need do is restore the base image and the latest Ghost/MozBackup files and I'm back up and running. At worst, all I'll have to do is reinstall Windows, Nero, Ghost and MozBackup (all on separate disks) and use that barebones install to recover from my backup disks.Flag Permalink This was helpful ( 0)Collapse -  (NT)  (NT) Everything.by Ryo Hazuki /  October 27, 2006 8:52 PM PDTIn reply to: What should be backed up?Flag Permalink This was helpful ( 0)Collapse - Being dependent on my PC for so many things...andby VAPCMD /  October 28, 2006 7:43 AM PDTIn reply to: What should be backed up?not wanting to spend the next 24 hours getting it backup and running, my backup consists of individual images of my first drive . . . partitions C: and D:, to a second internal hard disk drive. Those images are later copied to two external hard drives which I rotate bewteen home and work. The second internal HDD is a lot faster for backups and restores plus more reliable connectivity wise than externals. Only have to see posts in the STORAGE FORUM to get a sense of the numerous problems folks encounter with external HDDs. If my system won't boot or becomes corrupt beyond easy repair ... I do a restore of the C: image which takes about 15 minutes. If my first drives dies ... I'll install another HDD (a new spare) .. that'll add another 15 minutes. My PC is home built... so it didn't come with any restore discs. Overkill....maybe. Just don't want to lose my data or go thru heck trying to get my PC back up and running.

Does it require a floppy drive? I have a laptop computer which came with MS XP professional. MS XP has a backup program but in order to backup the entire computer for a total restore you have to have a floppy drive. which I don't have and haven't had one for years.Flag Permalink This was helpful ( 0)Collapse - Laptops are a different animal ....I use GHOST 2003 runningby VAPCMD /  October 29, 2006 2:52 AM PSTIn reply to: What backup software are you using?from a single floppy disk. The absolute height of simplicity for complete image backups and restores. I've also used Drive Image and True Image but always end going back to Ghost 2003. You can run True Image (and perhaps later versions of Ghost) from a bootable CD so anything that would do that and give USB access to an external USB or Firewire devices would expand the opportunities for use on a laptop. VAPCMDFlag Permalink This was helpful ( 0)Collapse - not at allby santuccie /  January 10, 2007 9:15 AM PSTIn reply to: Being dependent on my PC for so many things...andAbsolutely not! You are way ahead of most, and that's not a bad thing. Grif asked a very valid question, though, when he asked what you would do if your backup drive failed. I'd like to add something to that: When you have 100 GB of data to backup, you tend to run out of available space for your backups. And while Acronis allows you to make differentials or incrementals, you simply cannot keep backups of every change you've made. I have noticed, after laboring long and wearily in PC maintenance and repair, that problems have a way of showing up just after you get rid of your original backup! I strongly suggest you make at least one ROM image of your drive. If you have a newer version of Acronis, it allows you to split images into DVD-size volumes. I know what you're thinking: There's NO WAY I'm using 20-30 DVDs for all this!!! But this is what I do: I keep my newest backups on my external HDD for quicker, more convenient restoration, but I always keep at least one ROM copy of my entire OS in case my backup hard drive ever goes fritz. Note: Don't try backing up directly to optical discs. Most optical drives can't go without making a mistake, and dedicated backup programs like Ghost and True Image don't have the error correction to fix it. If the burner misses a single bit in True Image, you have a whole new set of coasters. Create a split archive in True Image, then boot back into Windows and use your burning ROM to create data DVDs with the .tib files. Then, if you're really paranoid, you can put them in a fire safe!Flag Permalink This was helpful ( 0)Back to Computer Newbies forum 19 total posts"
