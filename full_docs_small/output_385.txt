That material is called a drop and it impacts the length you need so the tablecloth fits your table and provides the look you desire.8 Inch DropThe drop length can vary depending on the dining event or personal preference. The standard drop length used by most food and catering services is 8"". This means that the tablecloth will drop 8"" over the edge of the table, evenly on all sides.10 and 12 Inch DropsYou aren't limited to only using 8"" for the drop in your tablecloth. Many people prefer the look of a 10"" or 12"" drop. However, these lengths tend to be uncomfortable for some diners since the tablecloth often bunches up underneath the table or makes it difficult for diners to move or even sit underneath the table. That's why the food service industry uses the 8"" standard.30 Inch DropIf you want the banquet look where the tablecloth touches the floor, then the standard drop is 30"". This drop length is used mostly for banquets dinners, especially wedding receptions. A 30"" drop length will mean that the tablecloth puddles slightly on floor.Quick Reference for Finding Tablecloth SizesUsing the chart you have a quick way to find the correct size for any standard size tablecloth.
