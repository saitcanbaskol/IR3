Welcome to HealthcareMagic forum. Nervous system is divided into many parts- central, peripheral, etc. If peripheral nervous system stops working, there is paralysis. If central nervous system stops working, there is coma. Person dies when heart fails and not brain. Dr. Rakhi TayalAnswered: Sat, 19 Mar 2011I find this answer helpfulAyurveda Specialist , Dr. Mohan Kumar 's Responsedear friend, yes you would die. because brain is the controller of all activities of the body. when your nervous system does not work, there are no impulses going to the heart so the heart stops beating. when that happens, there is no circulation. and the respiratory system is also paralyzed. so no breathing.Answered: Sun, 20 Mar 2011I find this answer helpful1 user finds this helpfulDisclaimer: These answers are for your information only and not intended to replace your relationship with your treating physician.This is a short, free answer.
