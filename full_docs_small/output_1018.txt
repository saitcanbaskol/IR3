"palpitation, fatigue, chills!Karen__0__0Hi...I have asthma and am currently taking Proventil, Vanceril and Beconase 2-3 x day. My heart skips beats daily...usually in the evening. Although this is scary, I'm not terribly worried, just want to know if this is a side effect from the drugs. My mother has a pace maker, and her father died from heart attack. My other concern is recent chills at night. I have NO FEVER, the house is warm (at least my husband complains that it is!:) ), and my hands, feet and nose are like ice. I am worried that this could be some kind of circulation problem. Any clues? My thermometer reads 97.8 to 98.3...what's the deal w/that? Is that the cause for the chills? How do I remedy this because it is really awful?

The proventil inhaler frequently causes palpitations or skipped beats. Proventil is a beta-agonist that acts on beta receptors in the bronchioles to decrease bronchoconstriction and relieve the symptoms of asthma. Even though there are different kinds of beta receptors in the heart, there is some cross-reactivity so that the heart's beta receptors are stimulated by beta agonists. As a result, premature atrial and ventricular contractions frequently occur which feel like ""skipped"" beats. These extra beats are benign and should not be cause for concern. As for the chills you're experiencing, it doesn't sound like you're having an infection nor that the chills are being caused by the asthma medications. You may have reduced circulation to the extremities. This is called Raynaud's Phenomenon and when it occurs, the fingers or toes become white and pale; cold hands and feet are not enough to make the diagnosis. If you are concerned about this problem, then you should see your physician. In the meantime, avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco would help. I hope you find this information useful.
