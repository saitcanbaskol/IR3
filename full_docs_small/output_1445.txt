In all there are 13 backcountry trails into the far reaches of the monument, ranging in elevation from 4,700 to more than 7,000 feet.""The Monument Canyon Trail leads to the classic tower that many people climb,"" Capp says. ""You can hike it down from the plateau or up from Highway 340."" The six-mile trail winds down the Colorado National Monument's longest canyon, passing a number of gigantic rock formations along the way.After the steep 600-foot descent from Rim Rock Drive, you'll pass the Coke Ovens, a series of large buff-colored mounds, as well as the Kissing Couple (use your imagination) before reaching 450-foot Independence Monument.
