"ingredientsKnow Your Ingredients: MethylchloroisothiazolinoneWhat it is Methylchloroisothiazolinone belongs to a group of compounds called Isothiazolinones.What it does Methylchloroisothiazolinone is a preservative: it protects products from the growth of fungi, bacteria and yeast, thus prolonging their shelf life.Side effects Methylchloroisothiazolinone is an irritant and a strong allergen. Because of that, it is mostly used, in small concentrations, in rinse-off products so the chances of it causing negative reactions are much smaller.

Do you know of any websights that would list such products?ReplybeautifulwithbrainsDecember 28, 2010 - 4:52 pmSheri, unfortunately I don’t know such websites but I know that some online retailers like drugstore.com and ulta.com list the ingredients of most of the products they sell. You can just search for a product you’re interested in buying on there and see if it contains Isothiazolinones. I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help.ReplyCarole winterApril 23, 2014 - 3:22 pmSheri,I had the North American patch test though a dermatologist and tested positive to it.If you can obtain the test it will tell you many products to avoid. Hair products /dyes ,paint,pet care,yard care. You won’t believe the hair and cosmetic products that contain it. I switched to Aussie hair shampoo and conditioner, ivory soap,all detergent.Hope this helps, if you are allergic this substance can wreak havoc to your skin and system.ReplyRebekah BaharestanJanuary 22, 2016 - 11:31 pmthere’s lists of products which contain Methylisothiazolinone as well as things that are known to contain the other isothiazolinones in the “Household product database” for cleaners such as dishsoaps and laundry detergent liquids, car care, floor care, room sprays furniture polishes etc. Do have a look at EWG “healthy guide to cleaning” and have a look at “skindeep’ app also by EWG (Environmental Working Group) for cosmetics ( put in your chemical and see what pops up, or look at ratings and stay in the green zone of 2 and under or A ratings. Also- go on facebook and look up “Allergy to Isothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone and Benzisothiazolinone ” to see reaction pictures, ongoing threads of comments, photos of products both free from these pesticide/biocide preservatives as well as those that contain them.ReplyGioJanuary 27, 2016 - 9:14 amRebekha, thank you for your comment. I think, if you want to avoid a particular ingredient, the EWG database can help, as it’ll tell you exactly which products contain it. But, when it comes to the safety of cosmetic ingredients, the EWG simply isn’t a reliable source.
