"QuestionSubject: GC/MS urine test Category: Health > Medicine Asked by: southernights-ga List Price: $50.00 Posted: 01 Nov 2006 11:41 PST Expires: 01 Dec 2006 11:41 PST Question ID: 779159A gc/ms urine test was given to me on 10/04/06 by my employer! I am on ridalin for ADD but that showed up as a negative for amphetamines on this supposedly fool proof test. I take a lot of advil on a daily basis as I suffered a broken back several years ago. I am 58 yrs old and a positive came back for THC. My employer is cheap I cannot see her paying $150 to $200 for any test and the test came back by fax in less than 24hrs. How long does it take to turn a gc/ms test around like this. Could she be lying to me just to intimidate me! When she found out I am a recovering alcoholic and have had no alcohol or illegeal drugs for 15 yrs. she backed up and mentioned false positive results. She asked me if I would take another urine test and I said of course! That was almost 3&1/2 weeks ago, she has not offered to give me a follow up test since then she is stone walling me now. That test is supposed to be 99% sure.Could that test have been a lie.? There were no control questions like what RXs or OTC drugs was I taking now, when I took the test! Please help me!AnswerSubject: Re: GC/MS urine test Answered By: tutuzdad-ga on 01 Nov 2006 13:29 PSTDear southernights-ga;  Thank you for allowing me to answer your interesting question. A GC/MS urinalysis is a dual laboratory test that utilizes a hybrid technology of both Gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS).  I recommend you first read this article to get a good overview of how the tests are administered and I think you will see just how difficult they are to defeat, how accurate they really are and how unlikely they are to provide false-positive results.  SCIENTIFIC.ORG http://www.scientific.org/tutorials/articles/gcms.html Before I begin let me remind you of our disclaimer at the bottom of this page. Before forming an opinion about your situation based on what you learn here, keep in mind that professional advice in this subject area is always a better course of action than online research. What I am telling you here is primarily public knowledge that I have ferreted out for you in an effort to answer your question.  As a general rule a GC/MS test takes about 23 minutes to run. However, most testing labs have quite a number of samples (simply by virtue of what they do) which they run all at the same time in an autosampler. Fifty samples, for example take about 24 hours to run. Even then, after the run is complete, a technician must examine each of the spectrum results from the chromatograph and log where the peaks have indicated the presence of specific substances with regard to each individual sample. The process is time consuming and I find it questionable that any lab contracted by en employer to perform a random drug screen not involving an emergency issue would have only one sample to test and would return the results via fax in just 24 hours. Such a report is theoretically possible, I suppose, but in my opinion not at all typical of what the process normally entails or what testing time normally permits. Here you will see an article from the Mississippi State Crime Lab (one of the smallest and least busy of all state crime labs in the United States) where this very issue is discussed. Clearly a state crime lab receives the most serious and urgent testing requests of any submitted and even THEY say that 50 samples take a minimum of 24 hours to spin up.  State Crime Lab Uses Combined Scan/SIM by GC/MS to Boost Drug Analysis Throughput http://las.perkinelmer.com/content/featured/stateCrimeLabUsesCombinedScan-SIMbyGC-MSCST.pdf In any laboratory test there is a potential margin for error relative to equipment, chemical, environmental, intentional tampering, unintentional contamination or human error. There is NO urinalysis that is 100% ?foolproof?. In fact, in my estimation a GC/MS test is probably as close to error free as a drug screen urinalysis test can be yet even this test can, and sometimes does, have problems because of the factors I mentioned. This level of accuracy is typically why the GC/MS if most often used as a second confirmation test rather than an initial (and less expensive) test. The federal government considers the GC/MS test the ?gold standard? of urinalysis tests and is one of the few agencies that I know of that administer this type of test as an initial analysis (though others may do it that I am not aware of). How do I know this? Well, as it turns out I actually happen to be a law enforcement evidence technician with more than 20 years of law enforcement experience; six of which are in this particular field or work. While I do not perform the actual GC/MS tests myself I do prepare forensic samples for testing, have some working knowledge of such tests and act as a liaison between a law enforcement agency and a notable state crime laboratory.  While Advil (Ibuprofen) can sometimes result in a false-positive for THC in some tests, a GC/MS should have detected it, identified it and isolated that detection from the naturally occurring and illicit substances (if any). In my own work the test results I typically receive list all the known elements that the GC/MS has identified.  As a rule, a GC/MS test detects what is PRESENT and not only for the presence of something IN PARTICULAR. In other words, if you were taking Advil, ?Ibuprofen? should have also been listed on the results as one of the detected substances. If THC was present ?Tetrahydrocannabinol? should have also have been listed on the results. On some lesser reliable tests where a specific substance is tested for and a false-positive has occurred, THC might show up IN LIEU OF Ibuprofen but rarely do these both show up because that is not the nature of the test. You see what I mean? They test for THC, detect some other substances that creates a false-positive result indicative of the presence of THC, but the test results shows ONLY THC and not the interfering compound because that compound was not specifically tested for. A GC/MS doesn?t normally provide this kind of result because it doesn?t JUST say there is A SUBSTANCE in your urine sample; it indicates WHAT ALL WAS DETECTED in the urine sample. That?s why this type of test is considered a gold standard.  You will see here in this chart prepared by Toxicology Associates, Inc., a company that tests blood, serum, urine, and solids for trace evidence of various substances, lists Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) specifically as one of the substances that a GC/MS test is designed to identify and detect.  TOXICOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC http://www.toxassociates.com/special.htm Having said that, the best we can do is to say, ?Yes, it is POSSIBLE that your sample was subjected to a GC/MS test and it is POSSIBLE that through some interference the test provided a false-positive result?. Not knowing your employer, her ethics or perhaps her underlying motivation (as you suggested) it is also POSSIBLE that you are being misled. The fact that you were promised a follow-up test that never occurred, given the fact that you already suspect you are being unfairly targeted, does give rise to suspicion in my opinion. If we are to assume the GC/MS test was a typical test with typical results, the fact that your sample was supposedly subjected to a GC/MS test and ALL detected substances were not on the results (if they was the case) is also an issue to consider. Since the legal implications vary from state to state and we are prohibited from offering legal advice, it is probably in your best interest to consult an attorney if the issue rekindles and takes a turn for the worst. Otherwise, in the event nothing more comes from it, maybe you should just cut your losses and let the subject go.  I hope you find that my answer exceeds your expectations. If you have any questions about my research please post a clarification request prior to rating the answer. Otherwise I welcome your rating and your final comments and I look forward to working with you again in the near future. Thank you for bringing your question to us.  Best regards; Tutuzdad-ga ?

A test like this one: http://www.drug-testing-solutions.net/homedrugtestkit.html might test positive for THC but certainly isn't going to indicate if the ""positive"" was caused by ibuprofen, not marijuana.  It's possible that she is stonewalling you now because after your admission of your history she considers you a poor employee risk and wants to get rid of you, even though you have been clean and sober for 15 years.  A quick review of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commissions page on EEO legislation would suggest that, if she persists in denying you the opportunity to clear your name, you might have just cause for a claim of discrimination in employment practices: http://www.eeoc.gov/abouteeo/overview_laws.html You might speak to her again, telling her that you have a right to have your own copy of the test results showing the type of test and the name, address, and phone of the testing lab, in addition to the results. Request the follow-up test she promised you. If she puts you off on either of these things, point out that you're sure she would not want to be investigated by the EEOC for discriminatory employment practices.  But before doing so, be aware that confronting your employer in this way may cause her to make your work environment unbearable in an effort to get you to quit, perhaps in subtle ways that cannot really be proven.  If that happens, however, or if she fires you because of your supposedly positive result, a labor-rights attorney could certainly advise you as to whether you might have a case for legal action.  I'm sorry that you're experiencing this, and I wish you the best in achieving a positive resolution.
