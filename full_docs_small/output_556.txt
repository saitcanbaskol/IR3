The first reduces the chromosomes number in half. The second is equal (mitosis) division. So for humans: A diploid cell has 46 chromosomes. Before starting meiosis, the chromosomes replicate (becoming double). So 46 double chromosomes separate into 2 cells of 23 double chromosomes each. Since each cell contains 23 chromosomes, they are haploid. But the chromosomes are double, so each cell divides, producing 4 cells, each with 23 single chromosomes. The answer is D 4 haploid cells.Roland Â· 8 years ago1 0 CommentMaybe you would like to learn more about one of these?Consolidate Your Student Loans Explore Digital Home SecurityWant to build your own website?
