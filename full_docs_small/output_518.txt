If they feel that their conditions are worsening then they should contact their GPs,"" he said.Kay Boycott, chief executive of Asthma UK, said the two-thirds of people with asthma who find that air pollution makes their condition worse ""will be at an increased risk of an attack"".AFP/GettyAir pollution lowered levels of visibility in LondonReutersThe air was hazy as Oxford University's rowing crew took part in a training session ahead of the Boat RacePAWarnings have been issued for people with asthma, lung disease and heart diseaseHealth experts said the ""vast majority"" of people would suffer no harm from the pollution levelsAdvice on the Defra website states that for high levels of pollution ""adults and children with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, should reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors, and particularly if they experience symptoms.""People with asthma may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often. Older people should also reduce physical exertion.""Jump media player Media player helpOut of media player.

But dirty air is an invisible threat, and it's taken a wind from the Sahara to blow it into UK headlines.The wind lifts desert dust high into the clouds several times a year. The dust provides vital fertiliser for the ocean and even the Amazon forest.But in the UK it is combining with high levels of local air pollution to irritate people's lungs.People with heart disease or lung disease or the elderly should take the health warnings seriously.The episode may draw attention to the government's long-term failure to reduce air pollution.The EU has launched legal proceedings against the UK for failing to reduce ""excessive"" levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution - mostly from traffic - after 15 years of warnings.Follow Roger Harrabin on twitterIt adds that ""anyone experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat should consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors"".A Defra spokeswoman said: ""The high level of air pollution this week is due to a combination of local emissions, light winds, pollution from the continent and dust blown over from the Sahara.""We want to keep improving air quality and have introduced a new five-day forecast service in addition to investing heavily in local and transport initiatives to tackle this issue head-on.""Meanwhile, Maria Arnold, from the environmental law group Client Earth, called for changes to the way pollution warnings are given, saying the public was ""generally very poorly warned about these type of events"".""We think the [warning] format needs to become very similar to the warnings for floods and heat waves. It is really important people understand the risks.""Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner Jenny Bates said air pollution was a ""national disgrace"".""There's not much we can do to control dust from the Sahara, but the authorities could and should be doing far more to deal with the UK's contribution to this air pollution episode, particularly from road traffic emissions,"" she said.Jump media player Media player helpOut of media player.
