Anthony has a dead-end job as a pizza delivery man and Ian is a stay at home YouTube stalking man-child. After Returning from the Game Bang game center, in which they were bullied by some street kids due to Anthony's pizza car, they find a video of Anthony reciting the Magic Pocket Slave Monsters theme (an obvious parody of the Pokémon theme song and a reference to Smosh's deleted video) at their high school graduation. In the video, Anthony attempts to impress his crush, Anna Reed (Nelson), by trying to do a backflip, but he fails, landing on his face, and resulting in the microphone going in his buttocks. They both decide to pull down the video before it blows Anthony's chances of reconnecting with his crush.They travel to the YouTube headquarters, where they meet a receptionist named Stephanie ( Helbig) who introduces them to the President of the company, Steve YouTube ( Michael Ian Black ). Steve explains that the only way to fix the video is by literally going inside YouTube through a portal and changing the video from the inside. Anthony decides that it is important enough to go through with it, so Ian accompanies him in traveling through YouTube.Steve provides Smosh with two electronic phones equipped with an artificial intelligence named Diri (a parody of Siri, voiced by Kimmy Gatewood ), and Steve shows them the portal that is behind his closet door. After tumbling through a series of YouTube videos, they eventually end up in a Jenna Marbles vlog. Jenna informs them that once their Diri phones run out of battery, they will be permanently stuck in YouTube, just like her; they find out there are two Jennas.They decide to split up, but Ian immediately abandons the mission and travels to his YouTube crush video, ""Butt Massage Girl"" (Brittany Ross), while Anthony escapes a furry party, gets advice from Steve Austin, and finds out that Anna really likes him too. Diri takes Anthony to the Butt Massage Girl video that Ian is getting a massage in. Anthony tells Ian that his and Butt Massage Girl's love is fake and that it's only a video.The duo then finally make it to the embarrassing video of Anthony. Anthony figures out that Ian was the one who recorded and uploaded the video. They both engage in a fight that lasts through three YouTube videos, ending with them returning to the start. Ian decides to make it up to Anthony by beating up his past self. Anthony then goes to help him, but past Ian interferes and attacks Anthony, while Ian is trying to knock out past Anthony. In the process, the other students also start to fight one another. During the battle, Diri reveals itself to be Steve YouTube, who tells them that sending the two into YouTube was part of his evil scheme to keep them in YouTube forever.Frightened, they race to escape YouTube via their video history, but Steve puts up several unsuccessful obstacles on their way, as they make it to the portal only for Steve YouTube to be there waiting for them. But a bear appears and kills Steve, allowing Smosh to escape YouTube. Returning to the real world, Anthony and Ian discover that, due to their changes to Anthony's embarrassing video, they have become famous, turning the video into the ""Clone Fight"" video; in which they met the President of the United States, created a movie, a TV show, and more. Through this, Ian is dating Butt Massage Girl, Ian's parents live with them, Anthony has thirty girlfriends (who he immediately gets rid of because he only wants Anna), they live in a much bigger and better house, and Steve YouTube (now You-too-bay) has Anthony's former job as a pizza delivery man and Jenna Marbles is the CEO of YouTube. Butt Massage Girl accompanies them as they go to their reunion.As they arrive to their reunion, they discover they are the most famous ones there. When Anthony seeks out Anna and finds her, he finds out that Anna loved him back in the day, but she was intimidated by him being rich and famous. It isn't until Anna sees him perform 'Magic Pocket Slave Monsters' (and successfully performing the back flip) that they kiss and get together. Butt Massage Girl and Anna meet onstage to which Butt Massage Girl reveals her name is Brad, to which Ian responded ""What the fuck!?""In a post-credits scene, Ian marries Brad with Anthony crying in the background.Cast  [ edit]Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox played themselves in the film.Anthony Padilla as himself, a former pizza delivery man who is now a Rich & Famous Alumni, and is also Ian's best friend.Ian Hecox as himself, a best friend of Anthony, and is also Brad's love interest.Jillian Nelson as Anna Reed, Anthony's love interest.Brittany Ross as Brad/Butt Massage Girl, a love interest of Ian.Michael Ian Black as Steve YouTube/Steve You-too-bay, the CEO of YouTube who is now a pizza delivery man and is also the main antagonist in the film.Stone Cold Steve Austin as himself, an adviser of Anthony.Jenna Marbles as herself, a previously YouTuber who is stuck on YouTube, and now the new CEO of YouTube.Harley Morenstein as The Mailman, the main enemy of Ian after been thrown some milk balloons by Ian.Grace Helbig as Stephanie, the main receptionist of YouTube.Peter Breitmayer as Mr. Ellis, the master of ceremonies in all high school reunion.Mark Fischbach  (Markiplier) as himself, a gamer on YouTube, who is responsible for nearly killing Anthony and Ian by playing ""Gorilla Chainsaw Massacre"" (a title name spoof of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre)Kristen O'Meara as Mrs. HecoxKevin Will as Mr. HecoxKimmy Gatewood as Diri, a personal computer assistance software who is sassy (a parody of Siri and is controlled by Steve).Gatewood also portrayed The Hair Stylist, a personal hair stylist of Anthony & Ian.Damion Poitier as Super Boring ManDominic Sandoval as Nearby StudentKimoon Kim as Psy LookalikeElisha Yaffe as High DriverHal Landon, Jr. as ButlerMari Takahashi as herself (cameo appearance)Matthew Sohinki as himself (cameo appearance)Joshua ""Jovenshire"" Ovenshire as himself (cameo appearance)David ""Lasercorn"" Moss as himself (cameo appearance)Shane Dawson as Sex Simulator Guy (unrated)Production  [ edit]Director Alex WinterOn September 18, 2014, Lionsgate announced that it has picked up the international distribution rights to the movie, while 20th Century Fox picked up U.S. distribution rights to the movie, with production jointly financed by DreamWorks Animation 's AwesomenessTV, and Defy Media.
