The course will show you more accurate (and easier) ways to spot lies.Lying Myth #2: Liars can’t look you in the eyes.We often think of liars as shifty in their gaze. However, liars actually look you in the eye more because they want to see if you believe their lie or not.Lying Myth #3: Emails and IMs are filled with lies because it is easier to lie when people can’t see or hear you. We actually lie most on the phone because there’s no paper trail and can’t see the other person’s face.Yeah…it’s kind of like a superpower.We are serious about lie detection don’t get me wrong—we have tons of science and research.
