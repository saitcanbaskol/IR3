Morjim beach and arambol beachthese beach situated in north side of goa. so these two beaches are less crowded beaches but best thing about beach is that most of the crowd is foreigner here that will make you feel that you have enter in goa .so make a visit to these two beaches as many of us didn”t went to his beaches because distance of this beaches from main city panaji is about 35 km.this is all about my experience .if there is any grammatical mistake then forgive me.HOPE YOU WILL ENJOY YOUR TRIP.1.3k Views · View UpvotersBhupendra Singh, Web Developer and SMO Expert at ARE InfoTech (2016-present)Answered Dec 25, 2017 · Author has 228 answers and 73.5k answer viewsOriginally Answered: What are the best things of Goa to do?There are so many tourist attractions in Goa and you need sufficient time to explore the beauty of Goa.
