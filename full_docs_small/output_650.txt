[1] The county is the site of the Revolutionary War Battle of King's Mountain.AgricultureSouth Carolina's agricultural weakness was in its soil. Agriculture during the time was often associated with spirituality. Tilling and tending the earth was seen as a sacred trust from God. Many preachers in the Carolinas gave sermons linking the neglect of the soil and the lack of agricultural success, and blaming the farming struggle on a decrease in religiosity. This led to not only an economic crisis, but also a spiritual and mental crisis. Farmers whose land suffered in South Carolina were experiencing a major self-esteem blow because of the alleged connection between agriculture and spirituality.Uncertainties in the cotton marked remained in a dejected state until 1850. The western states, however, were flourishing and the profit in the cotton market was booming. The farmland and soil was new and unpolluted, unlike the overworked soil of South Carolina. Many of the residents of South Carolina abandoned their farms and moved to Mississippi and Alabama where there were promises of better farm production. According to the 1850 census, 41% of all South Carolina natives had moved elsewhere, clearly because of the soil depletion of the area. If the Inman family was involved in the cotton market, their move between the years 1840 and 1850 from York County, South Carolina to Monroe County, Mississippi followed the typical migration pattern of destitute farmers.

All personal names and geographic features on these plats are included in the repository's On-line Index to Plats for State Land GrantsThe South Carolina Constitution of 1790 required the surveyor general to maintain offices in both the new capital at Columbia and in Charleston. The surveyor general began to use separate volumes for recording plats in his Columbia office in 1796. Before that, all plats were recorded in the set of volumes begun in Charleston in 1784. After 1796, most plats for land grants in the Upper Division of the state were recorded and filed in Columbia. The surveyor general chose to make the Columbia volumes a continuation of the state plat volumes begun in Charleston and gave the initial Columbia volume the number thirty-six to correspond with the number of the volume that had then been reached in the Charleston series. As a result, there are volumes numbered thirty-six through forty-three from each office, but the records in them are not duplicative.Also included are the Plan Books containing Plats and Plans.York County Land Warrants 1807-1816 South Carolina PioneersLocal HistoriesMoore, Maurice Augustus and Elmer Oris Parker.
