A large glass of warm water first thing in the morning helps, too. So does flax seed oil, it seems.....__________________ Vestibular problems, CFS, adrenal issues.01-15-2004, 08:03 AM # 5bassieSenior MemberJoin Date: Sep 2003Location: AustraliaPosts: 238Re: Drinking warm water for constipation, general bowle movements???I don't know about actual health benefits but I knew a lady who was stuck in a hospital bed in leg traction and she had a cup of hot water before anything else in the morning to keep her regular. It worked for her and she was in a position to need regularity01-15-2004, 02:00 PM # 6MrsLeeVeteran (female)Join Date: Aug 2003Location: NE USAPosts: 464Re: Drinking warm water for constipation, general bowle movements???If I drink a cup of tea or coffee, I go about half an hour later.

Frankly a cup of tea is more appealing and is still warm water. I would warm up a glass of cold water and not drink the warm water supply in the house. The above poster is correct in that warm water contains more dissolved minerals than cold water including lead from the solder used to connect copper pipes. Since the water in your hot water supply sit for longer periods of time in the pipes they get a higher loading of these minerals than the cold water supply does.01-16-2004, 03:56 PM # 9MrsLeeVeteran (female)Join Date: Aug 2003Location: NE USAPosts: 464Re: Drinking warm water for constipation, general bowle movements???This doesn't happen when I have a glass of iced tea or a pop. Only when it is a warm liquid.01-16-2004, 04:27 PM # 10SaralyInactiveJoin Date: Sep 2003Location: Glendale New York USAPosts: 252Re: Drinking warm water for constipation, general bowle movements???It's interesting because I would think that even something cold, by time it passes through the throat, stomach, intestines and finally reaches the colon, wouldn't be cold anymore.01-17-2004, 08:47 PM # 11jaydeesSenior Veteran (male)Join Date: Jul 2003Location: Ontario, CanadaPosts: 778Re: Drinking warm water for constipation, general bowle movements???Quote:Originally Posted by SaralyIt's interesting because I would think that even something cold, by time it passes through the throat, stomach, intestines and finally reaches the colon, wouldn't be cold anymore.It has to do with a stimulus that occurs in the stomach which causes the lower bowel to increase peristalsis (contractions) so it only has to be warm when it hits the stomach.
