What is a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) and how is it performed?The lumbar puncture is usually performed while you are lying on your side in a curled up fetal position but may sometimes be performed in a sitting position. It is important that you remain still during the procedure. Once you are in the correct position, your back is cleaned with an antiseptic and a local anesthetic is injected under the skin. When the area has become numb, a special needle is inserted through the skin, between two vertebrae, and into your spinal canal. An ""opening"" or initial pressure reading of the CSF is obtained. The health practitioner then collects a small amount of CSF in multiple sterile vials. A ""closing"" pressure is obtained, the needle is withdrawn, and a sterile dressing and pressure are applied to the puncture site. You will then be asked to lie quietly in a flat position, without lifting your head, for one or more hours to avoid a potential post-test headache.The lumbar puncture procedure usually takes less than half an hour. For most patients, it is a moderately uncomfortable procedure. The most common sensation is a feeling of pressure when the needle is introduced. Let your healthcare provider know if you experience a headache or any abnormal sensations, such as pain, numbness, or tingling in your legs, or pain at the puncture site.The lumbar puncture is performed low in the back, well below the end of the spinal cord. There are spinal nerves in the location sampled, but they have room to move away from the needle. There is the potential for the needle to contact a small vein on the way in. This can cause a ""traumatic tap,"" which just means that a small amount of blood may leak into one or more of the samples collected. While this is not ideal, it may happen a certain percentage of the time. The evaluation of your results will take this into account.^ Back to top2. Are there other reasons to do a lumbar puncture?Yes. Sometimes it will be performed to introduce anesthetics or medications into the CSF. Repeated punctures are sometimes used to decrease CSF pressure.^ Back to top3. Why do I need a spinal tap? Why can't my blood or urine be tested?Spinal fluid, obtained during a spinal tap, is often the best sample to use for conditions affecting your central nervous system because your CSF surrounds your brain and spinal cord. Changes in the elements of your CSF due to central nervous system diseases or other serious conditions are often first and most easily detected in a sample of your spinal fluid. Tests on blood and urine may be used in conjunction with CSF analysis to evaluate your condition.^ Back to top4. What other tests may be done in addition to CSF analysis?Other laboratory tests that may be ordered along with or following CSF testing include:• Blood culture to detect and identify bacteria in the blood• Cultures of other parts of the body to detect the source of the infection that led to meningitis or encephalitis• Blood glucose, total protein to compare with the concentration of CSF glucose and protein• CBC (complete blood count) to evaluate cell counts in blood• Antibodies for a variety of viruses, such as West Nile Virus• ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein), for indication of inflammation• CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel), a group of tests used to evaluate electrolyte balance and organ function^ Back to top"
