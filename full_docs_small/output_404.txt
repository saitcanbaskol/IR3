"Good Neighbor HotelsDisney Good Neighbor hotels are typically just a short drive from Walt Disney World. One of the conveniences of staying off-property is that some hotels may offer pet-friendly accommodations should they be needed. Disney’s Good Neighbor hotels can be a more economical choice than Disney Resorts or hotels located on Disney property.Both rooms and hotel packages for Disney Good Neighbor hotels can be booked directly through their individual hotel web sites or through most travel agencies. Limited Disney Magic Your Way packages are also available directly through Disney (not available online) or a travel agent. Disney Good Neighbor Hotel Packages are subject to the same WDTC Terms for deposit, cancellation & payment as Disney’s Magic Your Way Packages. We recommend using a Disney specialized travel agency, such as The Magic For Less Travel, with experience and training in reserving all types of Disney packages.Qualifications of Good Neighbor HotelsOffer standard rooms, suites and villa-style accommodations:Are AAA-approvedMeet Disney standards for quality and serviceHave a Guest Services desk to assist you with your Disney vacation planning and ticket purchasesProvide guests with access to Walt Disney World Resort information prior to arriving in the Disney Theme ParksAre comfortable, convenient and close. All are 2-14 miles away from Walt Disney WorldOther options such as vacation insurance, airfare, airport ground transportation, rental cars, Memory Maker, and Florida Beach hotels can be added to the Downtown Disney MYW package.Disney Good Neighbor hotel guests can not take part in Disney’s Extra Magic Hours, Disney’s free Magical Express round trip airport transportation or Disney’s Dining Plan. Good Neighbor hotel guests are, however, able to make Advance Dining Reservations for all Walt Disney World restaurants. Additionally, all Disney Good Neighbor hotels offer some form of transportation to and from Disney parks (a few charging an extra fee for the service). Transportation, however, is often limited in terms of hours and the number of trips to Walt Disney World Resort throughout the day. Thus, these hotels may not be a good choice for those traveling to Disney without a car or with no intentions of renting a vehicle.Good Neighbor HotelsBest Western International DriveBest Western Orlando Convention CenterBest Western Premier Saratoga Resort VillasBlue Tree Resort at Lake Buena VistaBuena Vista SuitesCaribe Royale OrlandoClarion Inn Lake Buena VistaClarion Inn & Suites International Dr./Convention CenterClarion Suites MaingateComfort Inn MaingateComfort Inn Orlando Lake Buena VistaComfort Suites Maingate EastCourtyard by Marriott Lake Buena Vista at Vista CentreCourtyard by Marriott / Marriott Village HotelsDelta Orlando Lake Buena VistaEmbassy Suites Orlando – Lake Buena Vista ResortEmbassy Suites Orlando – Lake Buena Vista SouthEmbassy Suites Orlando – I-DriveFairfield Inn and Suites CelebrationFairfield Inn and Suites by MarriottFairfield Inn by Marriott Village Hotels in Lake Buena VistaHampton Inn and Suites – South Lake Buena VistaHawthorn SuitesHilton Garden Inn Orlando/Lake Buena VistaHilton Orlando Bonnet CreekHoliday Inn Express & Suites Lake Buena Vista EastHoliday Inn Resort Orlando Suites – WaterparkHoliday Inn Resort Orlando – Lake Buena VistaHoliday Inn Orlando Southwest – Celebration AreaHome 2 Suites by Hilton Orlando International Drive SouthHomewood Suites by Hilton Lake Buena Vista – OrlandoHyatt Place Orlando / Lake Buena VistaLa Quinta Inn Orlando I-Drive NorthLake Buena Vista Resort Village & SpaMeliá Orlando Suite HotelOmni Orlando Resort at Champions GateQuality Suites Lake Buena VistaRadisson Resort Orlando – CelebrationRadisson Lake Buena Vista OrlandoResidence Inn Orlando Convention CenterResidence Inn Lake Buena VistaSheraton Lake Buena Vista ResortSheraton Vistana Resort VillasSpringhill Suites by Marriott Orlando KissimmeeSpringhill Suites Orlando Lake Buena Vista in the Marriott VillageSpringhill Suites Orlando at Flamingo CrossingsSpringhill Suites Orlando Convention Center/International Drive AreaStaybridge Suites Orlando – Lake Buena VistastaySky Suites International Drive OrlandoTownePlace Suites Orlando at Flamingo CrossingsWaldorf Astoria OrlandoWorldQuest Orlando ResortWyndham Grand Orlando Resort Bonnet Creek"
