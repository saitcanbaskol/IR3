"Best Mattress for Lower Back PainIn this ArticleIt Needs to Keep Your Spine AlignedWhen in Doubt, Go ‘Medium-Firm’Take a Longer Test-DriveJust Buy SomethingPillows and Positions MatterIf you have a bad back, you should buy the firmest mattress you can find -- right? Not so fast. While that used to be the common wisdom, there's no solid research behind it. The latest thinking is that there isn't one type of mattress that's best for everyone, including people with chronic back pain. Let personal preference guide you, and choose what feels most comfortable.But making the right choice can be tricky. So many products are on the market, and just because a mattress feels good when you lie down on it in a showroom doesn't mean you're going to be happy sleeping on it for the next several years.Here are a few tips to guide you:Continue Reading Belowyou might likeIt Needs to Keep Your Spine AlignedYou may not realize it, but good posture is important when you sleep. The muscles and ligaments (tissue that holds joints together) in your back need to relax and recover while you snooze. If a mattress is too firm -- or too squishy -- it won't support your spine at your neck or lower back the way it needs to. What's firm enough (but not too firm) is different for everyone: If you have wide hips, for instance, a slightly softer surface may be better. You need some more give in order to keep your spine in alignment. Someone with narrower hips might be better off with a firmer surface.When in Doubt, Go ‘Medium-Firm’Research is limited, but in one study, researchers assigned new mattresses to more than 300 people with low back pain. They used either ""medium-firm"" or ""firm"" mattresses for 90 days. Those in the medium group reported the least amount of discomfort.You might consider getting a memory foam mattress (instead of a traditional innerspring one). The foam molds to your body. The downside: Some memory foam mattresses keep in heat; and the material might have more chemicals.Take a Longer Test-DriveIf you have a great night's sleep and wake up pain -free after staying at a hotel or in a friend's guest room, copy down that mattress's model number. Or choose a mattress that comes with a money-back guarantee: A growing number of companies will let you buy a mattress and use it for anywhere from 30 to 100 days and send it back for a refund if you're not happy with it.1 2 View All"
