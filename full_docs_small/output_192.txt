"USC Salkehatchie PartnershipSince 1984, USC Aiken has partnered with USC Salkehatchie to offer a BA in Elementary Education to students in the Salkehatchie region. From 1984-2001, candidates on the Salkehatchie campus were able to take half the classes at USC Salkehatchie and the rest on the USC Aiken campus. Beginning in 2002, the Commission on Higher Education approved the entire program be jointly offered on the USC Salkehatchie campus. In 2005, USC Aiken and Allendale Elementary School entered a Professional Development School partnership where a number of professional education methods courses are taught on the Allendale Elementary School campus. This provides an opportunity for our candidates at USC Salkehatchie and faculty to interact with PK-12 students in a high needs area.For further information on the USC Salkehatchie program contact:Dr. Kay Burks, Program Coordinator,KarlinB@usca.edu (803) 584-3446 (Allendale Campus) (843) 549-6314 (Walterboro Campus)Dr. Judy Beck, Deanjudyb@usca.edu (803) 641-3269Aiken Salkehatchie Orientation Powerpoint/education/resources/AikenSalkOrientation.pptx"
