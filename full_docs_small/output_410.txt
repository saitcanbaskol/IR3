Although it's often referred to as Daylight Savings Time, there is no ""s"" at the end of saving.This year the clock falls back at 2 a.m. on Nov. 6, after which the East Coast will return to Eastern Standard Time, EST, after seven months of Eastern Daylight Time, or EDT. It has been almost a decade since the clocks turned back in October.Daylight saving started in the United States in 1918 after ""war time"" was established as a way to conserve fuel. It has since been adjusted twice. The most recent change occurred in 2007 and extended the time change by a month after the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was passed, which amended the Uniform Time Act of 1966. Between 1987 and 2006, daylight saving time lasted seven months.The previous clock switch started on the first Sunday of April and last until the last Sunday of October. Daylight Saving Time now starts on the second Sunday of March.The Beaver Moon next month will be superThunder Bay in Ontario was the first spot to use Daylight Saving Time. Germany was the first country to adopt the practice on April 30, 1916.The practice annually sparks a debate over whether or not changing the clocks to conserve energy is antiquated. Citing a study out of Indiana, many have said it actually increases electricity bills due to the demand for air conditioning, which led to a 1 percent increase in overall electricity consumption after 2006 when the state adopted Daylight Saving Time.But many still say they like the extra sunlight at the end of the day.Although 78 countries around the world observe DST, it is not in use in the industrialized nations of Russia, China, India and Japan. Many European nations observe DST.Arizona and Hawaii do not observe the twice-a-year time shift.Craig McCarthy may be reached at CMcCarthy@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @createcraig.
