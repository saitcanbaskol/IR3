"Energy Efficiency: Triple Glazing Exceeds ECO ExpectationsMarch 11, 2013UncategorisedWhat is triple glazing?Triple-glazing is now used instead of double glazing to create more energy-efficient homes. Already popular in Europe, and originally designed for the harsh winters of Canada and Scandinavia, triple glazing is now increasing in popularity in the UK. Modern windows are made from three panes of glass, providing greater thermal insulation than two panes. Double-glazing consists of two layers of glass with an air gap between them. Triple glazing consists of three layers and therefore two air gaps. While the glass is treated to make it more energy efficient, the air gap can be filled with an inert gas that helps to reduce heat loss.Triple glazing and insulationThe Energy Saving Trust report that over a quarter of all heat loss on domestic premises is via the windows. Triple glazing is thought to reduce heat loss by a third more than double-glazing. Better insulation will save homeowners money on their energy bills; much called for with rising energy prices.Triple glazed windows allow for greater solar heating, which means outside heat energy is trapped and stored within the home, and heat is kept in due to the thermal insulation properties of the windows. A house that benefits from wall, roof and floor insulation but without efficient glazing can result in cold spots around the windows that result in draughts and condensation. The standard of window glazing should match that of the insulation in order to maintain a comfortable temperature.Noise reductionA second benefit of triple glazing is noise reduction. Triple glazing improves the thermal acoustic performance of the glass and minimises volume levels from outside sources. A key element is the thickness of the glass. Different thicknesses block different frequencies, so it is best to have a combination of different panes with different thicknesses. This is called asymmetrical glazing. The weight of the glass also has a role to play, as sound is reduced by compact mass. The size of the air gap between the panes also contributes to the sound insulation. The gas used within the gap is normally acoustically resistant and helps reduce noise.SecurityAnother benefit is increased security. It is much harder to break through a triple glazed window than any other kind, which gives homeowners greater peace of mind.Where should I use triple glazed windows?Triple glazed windows are more expensive to produce, and the cost will typically come in at 20-40% more than double-glazing. It is also much heavier than double-glazing. Double glazed windows normally weigh about 30 kg/m2, where as triple glazed ones will weigh around 40 kg/m2. This extra weight is not a problem with vertical glazing as the walls and lintels can carry the extra weight. If you are considering triple glazing for a patio door or large skylight you may need to adjust the size of the frame to take into account the extra weight of the glass. A triple glazed frame should be deeper than a double-glazed one, with timber coming in as the top choice as it has better UV values than a metal frame. For the most eco-friendly option, choose an FSC approved durable temperate hardwood like oak.Article written by Safe Options who sells home safes and other home security products.Share this:Sustainable Homes"
