However, they question you should be asking is how long does it take for the antibiotics to completely destroy all of the type of bacteria that is making your dog sick  ( or cat ). That may take a few days. The length of time prescribed by the doctor should be sufficient. Usually probiotics are prescribed for any where between 3 days and 3 weeks unless there is something really really wrong.source: How long till antibiotics start to work in dogs?Was this answer helpful?
