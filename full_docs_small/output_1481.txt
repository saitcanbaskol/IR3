That's where underground gutter drains are helpful. They attach to the downspouts on your home and move water away from the foundation underground. Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them is similar to a process used to clear debris from the side gutter pipes on your house.1Pull the underground drain, which is often a black, corrugated, plastic pipe, away from the end of the downspout.2Place the end of a plumber's auger, also known as a snake, into the underground gutter. Turn the handle clockwise to extend the end of the auger.3Turn the handle counterclockwise if it becomes hard to turn; it's likely you've encountered a blockage. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of debris. Insert it back into the drain until you hit resistance again, then turn the handle back and forth to work some of the clog free. Pull the auger out periodically to remove debris until it moves past the blockage without resistance.4Flush water through the drain using a garden hose. Stand where the drain terminates, usually at the edge of your yard, to make sure the water is flowing smoothly through the drain.Things You Will NeedPlumber's augerGarden hoseMeasuring tapeTipsIf your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backward.Many home improvement stores rent plumber's augers that are likely long enough to meet your needs.Some underground gutter drains terminate in the sewer system instead of at the edge of your yard. In that case, measure from the downspout to the nearest manhole, and use an auger line at least that long to ensure you're cleaning the entire pipe.References  (4)Online Tips: Underground Gutter Drainage ProblemsWater Guide: Fixing Water Related ProblemsDulley: How to Repair Downspouts and GuttersThree Mountains Plumbing: How to Use a Plumbing Snake on a Clogged DrainAbout the AuthorBased outside Atlanta, Ga., Shala Munroe has been writing and copy editing since 1995.
