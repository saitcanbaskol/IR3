"How to Create a Relationship Class in ArcGIS 10Discussion created by mdawgmike86 on Jun 15, 2011 Latest reply on Jun 15, 2011 by mdawgmike86Like • 0 Comment • 2HelloI have been working in ArcCatalog and have several feature classes and tables that are related to one-another (with a unique ID to join/relate). I understand that being able to create relationship classes is a very handy feature as it would allow me to easily match up the data I have without having to manually create a join or relate each time I work with it.My problem is that I can find no way to do this with the version of the software I am using. Any tutorials or documentation I have come across say to right click on the feature dataset and point to ""New"" and then ""Relationship Class."" However, when I point to ""New"" in ArcCatalog, I do not have this option. I have ""Feature Dataset..."", ""Feature Class"", and several other things listed, but not anything resembling a relationship class.How do I create a relationship class (or equivalent) in ArcGIS 10? I have searched and searched and have found nothing.Visibility: Managing Data 1996 ViewsLast modified on Jun 15, 2011 12:01 PMTags: managing_data gdb _geodatabase"
