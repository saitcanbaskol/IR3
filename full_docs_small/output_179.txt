Over time, that once-sparkling flatware's finish becomes dull and stained. Even stainless-steel cutlery stains. In many cases, these stains can be rubbed away with items already in the kitchen; sometimes, it may take more than one method to completely remove a stain.1Pour a small amount of white vinegar onto a nonabrasive white cloth. Wipe down the cutlery with the cloth to remove general stains and marks such as white hard-water deposits. Rinse and dry with a fresh white cloth.2Fill the sink with 1 inch of hot water -- enough to completely cover a layer of cutlery. Pour in 1 tablespoon of baking soda, swishing it around to dissolve the powder. Add the cutlery to the baking-soda soak and allow them to sit for 10 or 15 minutes. Rinse the cutlery and buff each piece separately.3Add a squirt of mild dish soap to shallow bowl of hot water. Dip a sponge or dishcloth into the soapy water, then wipe cutlery tinted with a rainbow discoloration. This discoloration happens from a dishwasher that doesn't rinse and dry adequately if strong detergents are used to clean the cutlery, or if the cutlery has been exposed to extremely hot grease. Rinse and dry the cutlery after rubbing with the soapy water. This method also removes some chalky hard-water deposits left behind when cutlery is left to air dry.4Apply a dab of stainless-steel cutlery polish to a soft white cloth. Rub stainless cutlery to remove stains and restore shine. Rinse and dry as directed by the polish package instructions, which may vary by brand.Things You Will NeedWhite vinegarNonabrasive white cloth such as a tea towelBaking sodaMild dishwashing liquidSponge or dishclothShallow bowlStainless-steel cutlery polishTipsRinse food debris off cutlery immediately after use to help prevent stains.
