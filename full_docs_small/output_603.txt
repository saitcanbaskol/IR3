Electrons can move between different energy levels by absorption or emission of energy in the form of radiations. The energy that come from a source and travels through some medium or space is called as radiation. Radiations can be in the form of light, sound or heat. The radiations which can produce charged particles in matter are called as ionizing radiations. Usually unstable atoms emit this kind of radiation. Unstable atoms have excess of energy or mass and tend to come in stable form by emission of energy in the form radiations. Therefore unstable atoms are also known as radioactive. Radiations show dual nature (particulate and electromagnetic nature). Some common examples of electromagnetic radiations are gamma, X-rays. Similarly beta and alpha radiations are particulate radiations. Radiations can be measured in various units like Roentgen (R), Rad etc. Roentgen is used to measure a quantity called exposure. It measures the energy produced by gamma radiation and also used to describe the amount of radiations in air.Similarly Rad or Radiation Absorbed Dose is used to measure a quantity that is known as absorbed dose. It indicates the amount of energy absorbed in some material. It can be defined as the absorption of 100 ergs per gram of material. Another unit of radiation is Rem (Roentgen Equivalent Man) which is used to derive equivalent dose. Curie (Ci) is a unit used to measure a radioactivity. Here 1curie represents the number of particles / second from 1 gram of Radium.What is Penetrating Power?Back to Top The penetrating power of radiations is the measurement of energy of those radiations. As the energy of radiations increases, the penetration power of radiations also increases. Alpha particles can be blocked by a paper sheet whereas beta particles pass through paper and blocked by aluminum foil. Gamma rays require concrete, lead, or other heavy shielding to block them.Penetrating Power DefinitionBack to Top Penetrating power can be defined as the tendency of radiations to cross by certain mediums. It also indicates the energy content of radiations. Different radiations show different penetrating power.Penetrating Power of RadiationBack to Top Letâ€™s discuss some common types of radiations and their penetrating power. The alpha particles are heaviest particles and are produced during decay of some heaviest elements. They are particulate radiations and have high energy so they usually expelled from unstable nucleus. An alpha particle is ahelium atom with two neutrons and two protons.Beta rays or particles are energetic electrons which given off by the nucleus of unstable isotopes. These particles leave the nucleus at a speed of 270,000 km/ second. They can be stopped by an aluminum sheet or by air.Gamma rays are very high energy X-rays.They are energetic photons or light wave but much more energetic and harmful. These rays are capable of damaging living cells and can also be slow down by transferring its energy to surrounding cell components. So we can say that alpha particles cannot penetrate even a paper while beta rays can penetrate it but stopped by an aluminum sheet. Gamma rays are high energy rays and can penetrate paper and aluminum sheet but stopped by concrete layer.Penetrating Power of Alpha Beta and GammaBack to Top Alpha particles are positively charge particles which leave an unstable nucleus at the speed of 16 x 10 3 km / sec. It is around a tenth of the speed of light. They are relatively large and heavy particles therefore these particles are not very penetrating. Hence alpha particles can be stopped by a 3-cm layer of air.These particles easily transfer their energy to the surrounding medium and cannot penetrate the outer layer of our skin. It does not mean that alpha particles are not dangerous they are if inhaled or swallowed. Beta particles can be detected through the tube window. These particles are around 8000 times smaller than the alpha particles but are capable of penetrating living matter. The penetration of beta particles in living cells is deep enough and damages can pass to next generation also.Penetrating Power of x RaysBack to Top X-rays are photons or high-energy light-waves which are usually emitted by radium or cobalt. These rays can easily penetrate our body therefore also called as penetrating radiation. X-rays can be stopped by a thick lead barrier or a wall. Human bones or human organs are differentially penetrable and absorb the energy therefore no X-rays hit the sensitive X-ray film which gives a contrast in the form the picture of the bones.Penetrating Power of x Ray and Gamma RayBack to Top X-rays and gamma rays are mainly used in medical field medicine. X-rays and gamma rays are ionizing rays and have almost similar wavelengths but these rays are produced in different ways. Some of the body parts like skin and bone have tendency to absorb these radiations therefore the amount of absorption indicate the thickness and density of the material. Gamma rays have a very high frequency and cannot be seen. These rays pass through skin and soft tissues. They have high penetrating power compare to alpha and beta rays.Related TopicsChemistry Help Chemistry Tutor"
