Typically, withdrawals from 401 (k) plans before retirement age are discouraged or prohibited except under certain ""hardship circumstances,"" such as buying a home. However, withdrawals from 401 (k) plans are penalized on the amount withdrawn, plus the withdrawal is taxed as income. Unfortunately for plan holders, tax law has no 401 (k) hardship exemptions from withdrawal penalties and taxes, meaning withdrawing from a 401 (k) can be expensive.401 (k) Withdrawals401 (k) withdrawals under hardship exemptions, such as home buying, face 10 percent penalties on such withdrawals. Additionally, if you withdraw from your 401 (k) you must pay income tax on it at tax time. All taxes on 401 (k) withdrawals are due in the year the withdrawals occurred. Lastly, withdrawing money from your 401 (k) will cost you in terms of lost earnings on the money you withdrew from that 401 (k).401 (k) LoanFinancial experts advise that if you're going to use your 401 (k) to help fund your home purchase, do so through a loan instead. A 401 (k) loan, rather than a straight withdrawal, comes with certain advantages over that withdrawal. For one, the interest paid on a 401 (k) loan goes back into the account, meaning even more money eventually ends up in it. 401 (k) loan fees may apply, and if you default on it you'll owe standard penalties and taxes.Non-401 (k) AlternativesTapping traditional IRAs or Roth IRAs rather than 401 (k)s to help fund home purchases can also make sense. For first-time home buyers, withdrawals up to $10,000 from traditional IRAs can be made without tax penalty. Home-buying withdrawals from traditional IRAs have to be spent on home purchases within 120 days of withdrawals, though. Roth IRA savers can withdraw their Roth IRA contributions at any time in any amount without penalty. This is because they have already paid taxes on their Roth contributions.ConsiderationsMost financial experts strongly advise against out-and-out 401 (k) withdrawals because they can be so costly, penalty wise. 401 (k) loans can be for up to half a 401 (k) account's vested balance or $50,000, whichever is less, without triggering tax penalties. 401 (k) loans generally must be completely repaid within five years, though, meaning loan payments could be steep. Other alternatives to tapping retirement accounts for home purchase down payments and such include using second mortgages to fund entire home purchases.References  (4)Forbes: Tap Retirement Funds to Buy a Home?401kCalculator.org: Can I Use My 401k to Buy A House?Money Crashers: How to Withdraw from Your 401k or IRA for the Down Payment on a HouseThe Mortgage Professor: Use Funds in 401k as a Down Payment?Resources  (3)ConsumerReports.org: Resist the Lure of a 401 (k) LoanGoBankingRates.com: Should You Ever Use Retirement Funds to Buy a House?Good Financial Cents: 6 Ways to Claim Your 401k Early and Penalty FreeAbout the AuthorTony Guerra served more than 20 years in the U.S. Navy.
