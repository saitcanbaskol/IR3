"Calculate the number of carbon atoms in 5.00 g of blood sugar, C6H12O6 ?Chemistry3 Answers10Michael ShareNov 8, 20145g glucose contains 10 23 carbon atoms.The Mr of glucose C 6 H 12 O 6 is (6 x 12) + (12 x 1) + (16 x 6) = 180So 1 mole of glucose weighs 180g.There are 6.02 x 10 23 particles in a mole so 180 g of glucose must contain 6 x 6.02 x 10 23 carbon atoms.This equals 3.61 x 10 24 carbon atoms.So 1g of glucose contains (3.61x 10 24 )/180 = 2 x 10 22 carbon atomsSo 5g glucose contains 2 x 10 22 x 5 = 10 23 carbon atoms.Was this helpful? Let the contributor know!Yes5joseph c. ShareNov 8, 2014I will begin by saying that this sounds like a great homework problem.To answer this question you need to know 4 things. 1) the molar mass of blood sugar (glucose), 2) the mole ratio of glucose, 3) the conversion factor for mass to moles (Avogadro's number) and 4) the number of atoms in a mole.You can calculate the molar mass by adding up all the atomic masses of each element, C, H, and O. There are 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, and 6 oxygens. You will need the periodic table for this. Calculate on your own and check your answer below.You will need to use the molecular formula to get the ration of elements in glucose. In C 6 H 12 O 6 there are 6 moles of carbon. The mole ratio will be 1 mole of glucose to 6 moles of CarbonAvogadro stated that the atomic mass or molar mass of an element or molecule is equivalent to a mole of the representative substance.Avogadro stated that there are 6.02 x 10 23 atoms in 1 mole.After you have this information, you need to set it up in a ""T-chart"". This strategy is described here: Stoichiometry MapTo solve you want to follow these steps: 1. start with grams given 2. convert grams of glucose to moles of glucose 3. use your mole ratio to convert moles of glucose to moles of carbon 4. convert moles of carbon to atoms of carbon *be sure to cancel all your units, by cross multiplying.Here is the set up: Grams given x (1 mole of C 6 H 12 O 6 / grams of C 6 H 12 O 6) x (6 moles of carbon/ 1 mole of C 6 H 12 O 6) x ( 6.02 x 10 23 atoms of carbon/ 1 mole of carbon)Here is a video:The answer will be a big number because there are a lot of atoms in 1 mole ( 6.02 x 10 23 atoms, thats a big number ).I hope this helps.Answers: 1. 6 x 12.01= 72.06g of Carbon, 12 x 1.01= 12.12g Hydrogen, 6 x 15.99 = 95.94g of Oxygen, then add all these masses to get molar mass C 6 H 12 O 6 molar mass = 180.12g1 mole C 6 H 12 O 6 / 6 moles of C100.17g of C 6 H 12 O 6 = 1 mole of C 6 H 12 O 6, 12.01g = 1 mole of C6.02 x 10 23 atoms or molecules in 1 mole Answer: 1.00 x 10 23 atoms of carbonWas this helpful?
