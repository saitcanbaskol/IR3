"A Guide to Sunglass TerminologyFlash Mirror lenses offer just a hint of mirror coating but the eye can be seen through the lens.G-15 or G15 lenses. Human eyes do not respond equally to all colors in the visual spectrum. The eyes are more sensitive to green and yellow wavelengths and are less sensitive to red and blue. Based on this knowledge, the G-15 lens was formulated to emphasize the colors that our eyes see most easily and de-emphasize less useful colors.The G-15 lens absorbs 85% of visible light, transmitting only 15%. The light transmission curve of the G-15 (showing the amount of light that is allowed to pass through the lens) is similar to the color sensitivity of the human eye. What this means is that the lens transmits colors in the same way the tour eyes are sensitive to colors. This results in natural vision - true colors that are easy on the eye.Gradient or Gradient Lenses. Gradient lenses blend or fade color from top, it's original color, to the bottom, a lighter version of that color or a completely different color. (e.g.); a black gradient lens would blend from black at the top of the lens to a lighter gray color at the bottom of the lens. A rose-tan gradient lens would blend from the rose color at the top of the lens into a tan color at the bottom of the lens.Polarized lenses. When sunlight reflects off a horizontal surface like a road, water, snow or any shiny surface it often becomes concentrated horizontally. This is called glare.The vertically-aligned polarizing layer inside a polarized lens blocks virtually 100% of glare. Sunglasses without a polarized lenses do not block glare. Polarized lenses are great for everyday use but highly beifit fishermen, skiers, snowboarders and when driving.Polycarbonate or PC. Polycarbonate lenses are lightweight and high strength and resist scratching and cracking. The are 10x more crack resistant than standard Acrylic lenses.Revo Mirrored Lenses will seem to change colors depending on angle and light.Spring Temples are springs in the sunglass frame hinges. It extends the sunglass arms out further than standard frames allowing for a better fit and more comfort.TAC or T.A.C or Tri-Acetate Cellulose. TAC Polarized lenses offer a Hard-coat scratch resistant surface and 99% glare reduction. TAC lenses are stable in hot, cold and humid weather conditions and will not become loose or fall out of the sunglass frame.UV or Ultraviolet radiation is invisible rays that are part of the energy that comes from the sun which, not only, can cause damage to the skin of your eyelid but also the cornea, lens and other parts of the eye. UV exposure also contributes to the development of certain types of cataracts. The sun emits ultraviolet radiation in the UVA and UVB bands. All of our sunglasses protect from both of these UV bands."
