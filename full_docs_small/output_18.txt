"Personal TechVoice Searches With Cortana or ChromeTech TipBy J. D.

Although the hands-free command “O.K., Google” no longer works on the desktop version of Chrome, you can click or tap the microphone in the search box on the company’s home page and then give your spoken-word search request to Google.
