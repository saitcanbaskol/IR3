"On the small ribosomal subunit (30S), the anticodon of an aminoacyl-tRNA is matched by base-paired interactions to a nucleotide triplet or codon on the mRNA. The difference in binding energy between cognate and near-cognate interactions is not enough to account for the high accuracy of translation, and a key function of the small subunit is to discriminate against aminoacyl-tRNAs that do not match the codon on the message 48. This crucial step in the decoding process was poorly understood until the demonstration that the conformation of several residues on the 16S rRNA is sensitive to the structure of the minor groove of the first two base pairs in the codon–anticodon interaction 30. These should always show perfect Watson–Crick complementarity and mismatches alter the geometry of the minor groove. The induced change in the 16S rRNA therefore allows discrimination against non- or near-cognate interactions.This decoding function of the 30S subunit is assisted by a GTPase, the elongation factor EF-Tu  (EF1- in eukaryotes). In fact, each amino acid is targeted to the A site as part of an aminoacyl-tRNA–EF-Tu–GTP ternary complex, and hydrolysis of the bound GTP accompanies and signals correct tRNA–mRNA matching.At the interface between the ribosomal subunits, a canyon in the large subunit (50S) accommodates and orientates the 3' ends of the aminoacyl-tRNA and peptidyl-tRNA. The growing peptide chain is cleaved off the peptidyl-tRNA in the P site and joined to the amino-acid moiety on the A-site tRNA. This is the peptidyl-transferase reaction, which is catalysed by the 23S rRNA and results in the transfer of the growing polypeptide to the tRNA in the A site, leaving an empty tRNA in the P site. During this reaction, the mRNA is clamped in place by narrow entrance and exit channels that run between domains of the 30S subunit (Refs 4, 22 ). After peptidyl transfer, the translation factor EF-G binds to the ribosome and the 30S rotates relative to the 50S, accompanied by opening of the mRNA entrance and exit channels 22. The ribosome can now move forward on the mRNA to read the next codon in a process called translocation. This movement is associated with GTP hydrolysis by EF-G 22, 24. During translocation, the peptidyl-tRNA, still bound to the mRNA, moves into the P site and the uncharged tRNA that previously carried the peptide chain moves to the E site, ready to exit the ribosome 4, 21. The EF-G–GDP complex occupies the A site, which might help drive the translocation reaction 24,25, 26. This works because the three-dimensional structure of EF-G–GDP is generally similar to that of the aminoacyl-tRNA–EF-Tu–GTP complex, a phenomenon termed macromolecular mimicry 49. Finally, EF-G–GDP is displaced, leaving the A site empty and ready to accept the next aminoacyl-tRNA, and the 30S rotates back, clamping the mRNA. The steps of elongation are well conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, although in fungi (but apparently not other eukaryotes) tRNA release from the E site additionally requires ATP hydrolysis by EF-3.Like most G proteins, EF-Tu and EF-G show limited inherent GTPase activity. This is stimulated several fold by an accessory factor that is part of the 50S subunit and is now referred to as the GAR (GTPase-associated region)."
