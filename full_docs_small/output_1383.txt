"12PacThe essence of an MC - lyrics, flow, stage presence (ie. an MC that could Move the Crowd). Arguably, no other rapper has left a greater legacy than Tupac. The greatest contradiction in hip hop - social activist on one hand, artist at other times, violent mysogenist at others - Tupac LIVED his moto of Thug Life every single day. Tupac's impact transcended music like so many of the greats of the past. Rest in Peace.2Eric B. & RakimThe 'Rappers Rapper'. The 'God' Rakim pretty much set the standard as to what an MC should be. His laid back flow was rich in content and delivery and Rakim was the first rapper to bring to light the 7 Percent Nation of Islam teachings that many rappers would later follow.3KRS-OneThe Blast Master/The Teacher - the self-ascribed walking embodiment of hip hop. At one time, the most feared rapper in the world who no one wanted to battle. Credited as being the first 'gangsta rapper' with 'Criminal Minded' KRS also produced the most thought provoking, insightful records in hip hop history. All to dope beats and a flow that no one can ever copy or bite.4NasProbably the most introspective rapper to ever make an album. Nas is the modern day North American Griot - weaving intricate stories with a flow that few can ever capture. By his own admission, his experiments with the Nas Escobar-esq image didn't work - when he went back to being just Nas from the 'Bridge everything was right again. Hip Hop is Dead got a lot of people talking and far from being a 'hater' Nas was just trying to instill some fresh vibes to the game.5Ice CubeLong before making children movies and going ""westside ya ya"" on the world, Cube proclaimed that he's not a ""P-I-M-P""...just 'straight up N-I-G-G-A"". Cube made what is arguably the greatest hip hop album of all time ""Amerikkkas Most Wanted"", helped usher in the 'gangsta rap' era with NWA and then proceeded to add fuel to the vicious West-East Side war in hip hop. No other rapper has done so much for hip hop and at the same time, done so much harm to it. Almost an even greater contradiction than Pac and probably the most important rapper to come from the West coast.6The Notorious B.I.G.No other rapper had a better flow than Biggie. Period. His timing was impeccable, his delivery - lethal. Biggie's only fault was his limited subject range - he rarely gave insights into deeper thoughts. But at the end of the day, who cares? To this day, any time a Biggie track comes on at a party or club - the whole atmosphere changes. And that was what Bigge did - he 'moved the crowd' as an MC should.7JAY-ZThe heir to Big Daddy Kane's legacy, Jay-Z combined the old school braggadacio with tight lyrics and swagger. Jay could make tracks that would get the club rockin', make you think or just straight up want to fight. Reasonable Doubt is his crowning glory and on the basis of that album alone, Jay is a hip hop legend. His stage presence can't be beat and he represents the essence of an MC.8Big Daddy KaneThe Smoothest Rapper to ever don a high top fade. Big Daddy Kane tried to combine the essence of Malcolm X with Marvin Gaye and it almost worked. His flow was deadly, his smooth voice alone could get your head boppin'. He also ushered in the era of 'speed rapping' - a style we see so prevelant today. Another Kane innovation - the rapper as a dapper ladies man. Jay got his first break from Kane and owes a great deal to Kane (as do 99% of rappers today).9Andr√© 3000Big Boy's astro twin, Dre has consistently shown how he is the most innovative rapper alive. From Southernplayalisticadillacmuziki where Dre showed up his distinctive southern rapping style to his more recent projects like Idlewild, Dre channels all the great rappers of the past as well as Prince and George Clinton - the end result is a unique and amazing musician. Many rappers are just rappers - Dre is an artist and musician first and foremost - but I dare anyone to challenge his skills on the mic.10Kool G Rap & DJ PoloAll Gangsta (and Wanksta) rappers owe Kool G Rap a royalty cheque for biting his style. Kool G Rap was the original gangsta, telling vivid stories of crime and violence in NYC's undebelly that you could literally see in your mind. His distinctive lisp and swagger just added to his flow.11Chuck DDefinitely not the greatest MC on the mic - BUT - what other rapper crossed over across as many genres and demographics than Chuck D and Public Enemy? Furthermore, in an age where rappers are self-obsessed money whores, Chuck D had something important to say about society, human rights and social activism. Listening to Public Enemy connected to a world larger than your clothes and the club - it made you think! Music for revolutionaries and Chuck D remains hip hop's greatest representative.12CommonFor some reason, just because you rap about spirtuality, committed relationships and social issues, you get labeled as soft. For those who think of Common as Corn Bread (Electric Circus was definitely a mis-step), Com can definitely step to the mic and rip it to pieces. He's not afraid to battle anyone on the mic and definitely took Cube to school. A complete rapper who tries to be a complete human being and not just a silly corporate caricature of what white amerikkka thinks of black people.13LL Cool JSomeone get this man some chapstick! Ladies Love Cool James could definitely vie for the title of GOAT (Greatest of All Time) - if he stopped making records after Momma Said Knock You Out. Radio, Rock the Bells, Jinglin' Baby, Boomin System....has any other rapper produced more old school jams than this guy? After attacking Canibus (who did a good job of taking LL on), Cool J has swapped the mic for body lotion and has thus alienated all his male, hetero-sexual fans. For those of us old enough to remember a time when it wasn't lame to say you liked LL Cool J, he remains one of the greatest MCs of all time.14Slick RickThe original story-teller. Also in this day of bling and grills, let's not forget the original 'Blinged One'...the Slick Rick the Ruler.15Mos DefHip hop's Che Guevera - a hip hop purist. Mos Def's latest musical offerings have suffered as late (while his Blackstar counter part Talib Kweli has instead grown) which is probably due to his intense acting schedule. Yet, how can anyone front on Universal Magnetic or Black on Both Sides or Body Rock? Ms. Fatbooty is a hip hop classic and what other rapper actually made a song about water conservation and mathematics??16Q-TipThe Abstract Poetic is a remenant of hip hop's golden age - where NWA fans and De La Soul fans didn't beef about what type of hip hop was better - hip hop was hip hop. Tip was the founding father of the Native Tongues movement - a heavily jazz influenced style of hip hop that rapped about every single topic - from the inane (losing wallets in El Segundo), to the lustful (bonita applebum), to the amped (scenario), to the club focused (find a way). Afrocentricly focused, togehter with De La Soul, Q Tip introduced a brand of hip hop that broke the mold, dared to innovate but never took itself too seriously.17Too $hortG's up, hoes down. Too F'n Short was the original PIMP to grab a mic and educate. The word Pimp has become so pervasive now that it's lost all edge. Another rapper that all current day MCs owe a huge debt to for their education in the art of pimpin.18Method ManTical has the most unique voice in hip hop. The front man for the legendary Wu Tang Clan, Meth's grimy voice and subject matter provided balance to the over jiggyfied hip hop world of the late 90s. His MC skills continue to grow, but nothing will ever top his unique torture methods...19EminemSome probably feel Em should be ranked higher and I would agree to an extent. Possesing a wicked imagination and MC battle skills, Em is nice on the mic. He's opened up hip hop to a whole new generation of fans who would have never otherwise listened to hip hop while maintaining his game.20GuruThe Monotone great - Guru goes under-appreciated whenever the topic rappers comes up. True, Primo was instrumental in Guru's rise to fame - but think about a Primo beat without Guru (which is common these days) - something is missing! Guru also helped the careers of greats such as MOP, Group Home, Jeru and Afu-Ra. And it's that monotone voice that drops street stories, social activism and knowledge. Definitely worth of the title Guru.21Scarface1/3 member of the Houston based Geto Boys, Scarface was the first southern rapper to gain signficant commercial success. His lyrics were simple but definitely had an impact. His voice brought more diversity to the world of hip hop, giving us a glimpse of living in the Southern ghettos.22Snoop DoggWhat other rapper's lexicon has made its way into mainstream vernacular? In other words, Snoops is the shizzel. Dr. Dre and Snoop ushered in a whole new era of G Funk and made the west coast sound the dominant force in hip hop for years to come.23DMXIn between the time he dropped ""Natural Born Loser"" and before he went completely insane, DMX was a force to be reckoned with. 'Damien' is probably one of the creepiest hip hop tracks ever put to wax and gave us a glimpse into DMX's awesome potential. Unfortunately, that potential was never met and who knows if X can ever get back in the game again.24KuruptPhilly's Kurupt is no gimmick rapper as some have unfairly labeled him because of his association with the Dogg Pound. Kurupt is more than a capable rapper that can stand his own ground - whether or not he has the Dogg Pound behind him or not.25BuckshotWhy Buckshot and the whole Boot Camp Clik gets no love is beyond me. Black Moon, BCC, Smif N Wessen were keeping real hip hop alive in NYC while the jiggy ish was playing itself out. The grimiest group of MCs, Buckshot and the whole duck down crew had a flow that made you want to rock Tims and oversized hockey jerseys...Pac himself was a huge fan of these guys."
