"Skin ReactionsWhat Are Skin Reactions?Includes: dry  skin, flushing , hyperpigmentation, nail changes, photosensitivity , radiation recall , rash.Skin reactions to drug therapy are extremely common. All drugs may induce  skin reactions, although if they do occur they are usually mild, however, some skin  reactions are serious and potentially life-threatening. Because of this, all  drug-associated rashes should be reported to your health care professional for evaluation.The cause of skin reactions is often unknown although many have an allergic or toxic  basis. Skin reactions can be independent of dose and can persist long after the drug causing  the allergic reaction has been discontinued. For example, with a hypersensitivity  reaction to penicillin, the skin condition may worsen for seven to ten days after  the drug has been stopped. It is especially important that allergic skin reactions  are correctly identified, since future exposure to the same drug could cause much  more severe skin reactions.Toxic reactions, in contrast, are dose-dependent and skin reactions generally  resolve fairly soon after the drug causing the reaction is stopped.There are factors that may increase the risk of developing skin reactions, which  include:Liver diseaseKidney diseaseSystemic lupus erythematosus (lupus)AIDSDrug allergies are more common in the elderly and may be related to development  of an immune response or to an increased exposure to drugs. The way drugs  are given can influence drug allergy; in general, topical application (applied directly  on the skin) has the greatest likelihood to induce skin reactions, followed by intravenous  (IV) then medications given by mouth.Types of Skin Reactions:Dry SkinWhat is dry skin?Dry skin is characterized by mild scaling, roughness, feeling of tightness, and possibly  itching. With dry skin reactions, the skin cells at the lower layer of  the epidermis (top layer of skin) are dry and flat, with no moisture. Factors  that contribute to dry skin reactions include:DehydrationExtreme weather conditionsPerfumed productsAllergyWhen a moisturizer is used on the surface of the skin, the product penetrates and  restores moisture to the skin cells. Creams and lotions are effective ways  of restoring moisture following dry skin reactions. Ointments are designed  to be a barrier and stay on the surface of the skin for protection against harsh  elements.Things you can do to manage dry skin reactions: Avoid:Perfumed productsBubble bathSoap, particularly perfumed soaps.Soap-free cleansing bars, these can be drying and potentially irritating.Lanolin-based creams, lotions, ointments etc.Anything that you think you might be allergic to. (common allergy-causing agents;  detergents, plants, pets, harsh chemicals in household cleaning products, rubber  gloves, jewelry, feathers, grass and pollen, artificial fingernails and adhesive).Personal Hygiene:Dry yourself by patting your skin with a soft towel, rather than rubbing vigorously.Use mild, non-perfumed, non-deodorent soaps such as Dove, Basis, Aveeno  or Neutrogena dry skin soaps. Or low allergy soap of soap substitute  - cream, cleaning gels.Take showers or short, cool baths instead of long, hot baths.Shaving for men - if dry skin reactions occurs on your face, skip a couple of days  (over a weekend?) to give your face a rest. Do not use perfumed after-shave.Shaving for women - if after shaving your legs a rash appears do not shave again  until the skin has completely healed.Clothes:Wear cotton clothes where possible next to the skin, rather than wool, synthetic  fibers or rough clothing.Wash clothes in mild detergent.Weather:Extreme weather conditions can worsen and cause dry skin reactions (hot and  sunny, cold and windy).Wear gloves in cold weather.Avoid sun exposure. Wear SPF 15 (or higher) sunblock and protective clothing.Fluids:Drink plenty of fluids keep your body well hydrated. You should drink 2-3  quarts of non-alcoholic, non-caffienated beverages daily, unless you are instructed  to restrict your fluid intake.Lotions and creams:Use moisturizers regularly. Moisturizers prevent water loss by layering an oily  substance over the skin to keep water in or by attracting water to the outer skin  layer from the inner skin layer. Substances that stop water loss include petroleum,  mineral oil, lanolin and silicone products. Substances that attract water to the  skin include glycerin, propylene glycol, proteins and some vitamins.Bath oils such as baby oil, mineral oil, Herbal Bath Oil, Lubriderm Bath Oil, or  Neutrogena Body Oil can be applied to your wet skin after you emerge from the bath  or shower.Protect hands:Always rinse and dry hands carefully, particularly after contact with cleaning products.Wear rubber or vinyl gloves to protect hands, underneath wear thin cotton gloves. Do not wear for long periods of time. (Wash the cotton gloves frequently).Note: We strongly encourage you to talk with your health care professional  about your specific medical condition and treatments.

Flushing is due to a variety of causes such as certain chemotherapy  drugs. Carcinoid tumors can also cause flushing as part of carcinoid syndrome. Other causes are alcohol and other drugs.Several chemotherapy drugs are associated with this flushing such as: asparaginase,  bleomycin, carboplatin, carmustine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, dacarbazine, diethylstilbestrol,  docetaxel, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, lomustine, paclitaxel, plicamycin, procarbazine,  and teniposide.Biologic therapies associated with flushing include interleukin-2.Note: We strongly encourage you to talk with your health care professional  about your specific medical condition and treatments.

This can occur as an overall darkening  of the skin, or it can be localized. This may be connected to phototoxic reaction  where the areas exposed to light may have a golden-brown or slate-grey  color change. Some drugs will cause changes in the nails, darkening of the tongue,  gums, and over finger joints. Most sking reactions occur within two to three weeks  of initiation of chemotherapy and resolve 10 to 12 weeks after stopping treatment.Hyperpigmentation most commonly accompanies use of alkylating agents and antitumor  antibodies.Methotrexate may produce a characteristic ""flag sign"" on the hair - horizontal hyperpigmented  bands alternating with normal hair color in light-haired individuals.Discoloration can occur in areas of pressure, such as under tape or dressings. This has been reported with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, ifosfamide, thiotepa,  docetaxel, and etoposide.Serpentine hyperpigmentation: Some chemotherapy drugs (fluorouracil, vinorelbine,  and some combination regimens) given intravenously (IV) can cause a darkening of  the venous pathways up the arm. This darkening over the veins will eventually fade.The cause of these skin reactions is currently unknown, but may involve direct toxicity,  stimulation of melanocytes (cells in skin responsible for skin color), and postinflammatory  changes. Although skin reactions may occasionally be permanent,  in most cases, discoloration will gradually resolve after chemotherapy is stopped.Note: We strongly encourage you to talk with your health care professional  about your specific medical condition and treatments.

There are several types of nail changes which may occur in patients receiving  chemotherapy. The most common of these skin reactions seen, particularly in  dark-skinned persons, is hyperpigmentation (darkening). Vertical or horizontal  bands, or general darkening. Drugs in which these skin reactions been known  to occur include:Bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, hydroxyurea,  aminoglutethimide, busulfan, cisplatin, dacarbazine, docetaxel, idarubicin, ifosfamide,  melphalan, methotrexate, mitomycin and mitoxantrone.This hyperpigmentation generally grows out with the nail.Other nail changes include:Beau's lines (horizontal depressions of the nail plate). These skin reactions  can occur a few weeks after a course of chemotherapy.Mee's lines (white horizontal discoloration of the nail plate involving the entire  nail width).Leukonychia (white horizontal discoloration involving partial nail width).Onycholysis (The separation or loosening of a fingernail or toenail from its nail  bed).Onychodystrophy (A malformation of the nail).All of these skin reactions are temporary and eventually resolve once  the drug causing the change is stopped and the affected nails grow out (this may  take weeks to months).Things you can do to manage nail changes:Nails should be trimmed and kept clean.Gloves should be worn for housecleaning and gardening to minimize damage and prevent  infection.Nail polish and imitation fingernails should not be worn until the nails have grown  out and returned to normal.Drugs that may be prescribed by your doctor for skin reactions:Antibiotics may be necessary to treat infections in the nail beds.Notify your doctor or health care provider if:You suspect an infection of the nails.Note: We strongly encourage you to talk with your health care professional  about your specific medical condition and treatments.

Photosensitivity is an enhanced skin response to ultraviolet radiation  (sunlight). There are three types of photosensitivity reactions phototoxic,  photoallergic and UV recall reaction.Phototoxic reactions are common photosensitivity reactions  and can be produced in most individuals given a high enough dose of drug and sufficient  light exposure. These photosensitivity reactions are usually evident  within 5-20 hours of exposure and resembles an exaggerated sunburn (redness, swelling,  blistering, weeping and peeling). The rash is confined to areas exposed to  light.Drugs associated with these photosensitivity reactions are dacarbazine, fluorouracil,  methotrexate and vinblastine.Photoallergic reactions are less common than phototoxic  reactions. A photoallergic reaction is similar to a phototoxic reaction but  the reaction may spread beyond area's exposed to light. A drug that may  have this photosensitivity reaction is flutamide.UV recall reaction causes a sunburn reactivation if the  drugs are administered within 1 week of obtaining a sunburn. This reactivation  may actually be more severe than the primary sunburn.Things you can do to manage photosensitivity:Prevention:Use sunscreen or protective clothing when out in the sun, even on cloudy days.Sunblock with physical barrier such as zinc oxide, may be needed.Avoid tanning booths.Being able to tan previously without damaging burns or skin reactions to sunlight  does not mean that skin will respond the same way while on chemotherapy or radiation.Reduce inflammation:Use cool wet dressings.Apply lotions.Drugs or treatments your doctor may recommend or prescribe for photosensitivity  reactions:Topical creams containing corticosteroids and/or anti-itching properties.If a reaction is severe systemic corticosteroids may be prescribed.Note: We strongly encourage you to talk with your health care professional  about your specific medical condition and treatments.

Radiation Recall is a redness that can occur at the site of previous radiation  when certain chemotherapy drugs are given. Radiation recall resembles severe sunburn  in the area of the previous radiation.This effect of radiation recall can occur from 8 days to 15 years after radiation  therapy.These skin reactions are most commonly associated with antitumor antibiotics such  as dactinomycin and doxorubicin.Treatment of radiation recall is symptomatic with an effort to avoid or treat secondary  infections that may occur. Sometimes corticosteroids may be used in order  to allow continuation of offending drug without further radiation recall effects.Things you can do to manage radiation recall:Stay out of the sun and avoid tanning beds.If you must be out of the sun, use protective clothing and sunscreen with SPF 30  or higher over previously radiated skin.Note: We strongly encourage you to talk with your health care professional  about your specific medical condition and treatments.

A rash is a general term for skin reactions, some more specific terms are  used to describe what the rash looks like such as:Erythematous - redness.Macular - small, distinct, flat areas.Papular - small raised lesions.A macularpapular rash is the most common type of drug-induced skin reaction. These skin reactions usually start on the trunk. The arms and legs are often  involved but the face may be spared. The rash is usually bright red in color  and the skin may feel hot, burning or itchy. This rash can occur with almost  any drug at any time up to two to three weeks after the drug has been given, but  are most common within the first 10 days.A severe form of this type of rash would be a wide spread, red rash that blends  together. Often associated with peeling of the skin, and desquamation (areas  of wet or dry open sores). There may be other symptoms such as fever, lymph  node enlargement, and loss of appetite.Hives: raised, itchy, red blotches or wheals which  may be pale in the center and red around the outside. This is also a common  drug reaction usually occurring within 36 hours of drug exposure. The lesions  rarely last for more than 24 hours. However on giving the drug again the skin  reactions may develop within minutes.Management of hives involves stopping the causative agent and treatment with antihistamines.Swelling or edema may also occur with hives as part of an allergic reaction. It is a vascular reaction resulting in an increased ability for fluid in the cells  to ""leak"" into the layers of the skin causing swelling. These skin reactions  happen much less often than hives alone. The tongue, lips, or eyelids are  generally affected. Swelling of the airways can result in difficulty  breathing, closing off of the airway and death. If swelling is happening and  any sign of breathing difficulty seek help immediately.Acne: Some drugs can cause or make acne worse. The lesions in acne like rashes are papular and pus filled but blackheads are usually  absent.Drugs commonly associated with this type of rash are corticosteroids, androgens  (in females), dactinomycin, vinblastin, oral contraceptives.Psoriasis: Typically described as reddish patches  covered with large dry silvery scales.Some drugs are associated with psoriasis in persons with no prior history of this  skin condition (interferon alfa) or occasionally can worsen pre-existing psoriasis  (interferon alfa and interleukin-2).Purpura: A condition characterized by bleeding under  the skin or mucous membranes. This results in the appearance of purplish  spots or patches.The main cause of these skin reactions is thrombocytopenia (very low platelet  count).Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS): A very severe, uncommon  skin reaction that includes flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, generalized aches,  fatigue) and extensive skin reaction with a variety of patterns. Skin  reactions may include skin blistering and erosions.This syndrome is frequently drug induced.A large number of drugs have been implicated as a cause of SJS, most common are  penicillins, tetracyclines, sulphonamides and NSAID's (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs).Drugs that may be responsible for these skin reactions should be stopped immediately.Patients are usually hospitalized to receive IV corticosteroids, fluid replacement  and antibiotics, if needed.Drug rechallenge is never justified.Things you can do to manage rashes:Wear loose non-irritating clothing.When bathing use a mild soap with out perfumes.When washing and drying the skin gently pat the area instead of rubbing with the  towel or washcloth.Use sunscreen or protective clothing when out in the sun, even on cloudy days.Avoid tanning booths.Previous history of skin tanning without damaging burns or skin reactions to sunlight  does not indicate that skin will respond the same way while on chemotherapy or radiation.Drugs that may be prescribed by your doctor:Corticosteroid creamsSunscreensCalamine lotion for itchingAntihistamines to treat an allergic response.Analgesics (pain medications) if a painful rash is present.When to call your doctor or health care professional about skin reactions:Swelling, chest pain or difficulty breathing (signs of an allergic reaction). Seek help immediately and notify your health care professional.Fever of 100.5° F (38° C) or higher, chills (possible signs of infection).Unexplained or worsening skin rash.Itching, pain or other troubling symptoms accompanying a rash.Rash affecting the mucous membranes in the mouth or nose.Any blistering, peeling, open areas in the skin.If you suspect an infection in the skin or nails.Note: We strongly encourage you to talk with your health care professional  about your specific medical condition and treatments.
