I found out I have very low progesterone, while all my other hormones seem to be in the normal range (however doctors determine that). For now, my main concern is boosting my progesterone without messing with any other hormones like estrogen or testosterone. I read some old threads about progesterone creams (yam-derived are supposed to be the best, like the one from kokoro). Is anyone still having success with progesterone cream? I'm a bit nervous to use it as I read that it can cause unwanted weight gain and fat storage. I will mention it to the endocrinologist when I have my appointment, but I wanted to get input from people who have actually used it to control their imbalance and acne.Are there any other herbal treatments that might help regulate my progesterone? Most sources recommend vitex, which I already tried in the past, but that also affects estrogen and it also influenced my androgens so I wouldn't want to risk it again."
