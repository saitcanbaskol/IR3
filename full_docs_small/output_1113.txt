Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Darkness.Could you tell me the similarities, differences and what Pokemon you can become?Thankyou. ~MysteriousLucario :3edit: Which game can you become Riolu?mystery-dungeon version searchasked Jan 27, 2013 by pkmn Trainer Robinedited Jan 27, 2013 by Pokemaster2 Answers1vote Best answerThere's a bit too much to list here, so I'll give you the Bulbapedia links:Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of SkyPokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of DarknessSince Explorer's of Sky is the later version, look under New Features to see what's different from Explorer's of Time/ Darkness (which are sister versions). There are a lot of small differences as well, with NPC changes etc., that don't really affect the main game play. There are a few new starting Pokemon/ playable characters added, so now you can be a Riolu etc. EDIT: Riolu was added in Explorers of SkyI enjoyed the Explorer's of Darkness storyline a bit more, but that was just me. The Secret Bazaar feature in Explorers of Sky was pretty neat though; it made dungeons easier.answered Jan 27, 2013 by fondantselected Jan 27, 2013 by pkmn Trainer Robinthanks marzipan. I'll ask for Explorers of Sky for mah birthday xD. Oh and, i prefer the old ones like red rescue team and blue graphics better than what i saw in the 3ds one. thats just what i like realy. i think these storylines moved me. T-T But yeah, thanks :3commented Jan 27, 2013 by pkmn Trainer RobinDarkness is way better. So much more wonder mail codes and things. I never played sky though :Pcommented Jan 27, 2013 by GʟɪɢᴜʀʀYou might want to consider the new series coming out, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Gates to Infinity (in case you didn't know). It'd be out in March, but for 3DS only.commented Jan 27, 2013 by fondant1voteThe differences are the same in most games. You can find different Pokemon in the two. If you want new transformations, get explorer of the sky. Those are really the only differences ingameanswered Jan 27, 2013 by zetazord210"
