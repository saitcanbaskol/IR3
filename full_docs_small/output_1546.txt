I was so worried as i had had a horrible experience in the past. Amazed with the quality, dye has stayed on and looks great. I have blonde hair and was worried it may come out dark but its a perfect colour. Thanks so much girls and boys!Aug 18, 2017Loving my tinted eyebrowsSnowflakeLocation: Kingsville MO Eyes: Green Skin tone: LightHave been using the brow bar at Ulta. Tried tinted with my normal brow service. Love it! I washed my face when I got home, I still had brows! I have blonde, very light strawberry blonde and before tint, you could not see my brows. Hoping it will last for a few weeks, time will tell.Aug 7, 2017Horrible!BriLocation: BloomingtonTo my fellow optimistic cosmetic lover, this is not the answer to problemed brows. I was promised that the tint would last 4-ish weeks. Still, I was afraid to wash my face the first few days, and for good reason. After 4 days I washed my face, and the tint came right off. None of it left, and my money was gone. This is not worth your time.Jun 26, 2017Lash tinting is life changing!!BENEFIT - PRESTON CENTER - DALLASLocation: Dallas, Texas Eyes: Blue Skin tone: FairLove that it's: “Effortless”Went to the Beneft in Dallas and got my lashes tinted for the first time. It is the BEST thing I've ever done! Being super blonde and pale, I always feel like I have to wear mascara - even when I'm not wearing makeup. But now with my lashes tinted, I don't have to anymore!!May 9, 2017Love My Brow Tint at Legacy BoutiqueBeauty Basher in PlanoLocation: Plano, TX Eyes: Brown Skin tone: LightLove that it's: “Adds to my happiness, Beautiful brows”Janelle did an amazing job on my brow tint. Will be returning for this service. Felt like a million bucks :) It looks very natural, and stunning.May 8, 2017Awful experienceRisty 123Location: Colchester uk Eyes: Blue Skin tone: FairI had my brows tinted and waxed today and they were tinted way to dark for my blonde hair, she kept telling me one was darker than the other then applying more tint! It also very patchy and I won't be returning for this particular service.Apr 15, 2017Horrified!ClarieLocation: Australia Eyes: Blue Skin tone: FairThe first time I went to a benefit brow bar I got the brow tint and wax combo. I was hesitant as I do have pale skin, strawberry blonde hair and my natural eyebrows are very light so I didn't want the tint to be un-natural looking. The lady was nice and assured me she knew what she was doing. I ended up happy with the result although they were a bit too dark for my liking. After the success of the first appointment, I went back for a second. Many regrets. The lady seemed to know what she was doing but didn't pay much attention to what I wanted and rather did her own thing. While I hoped to come out with eyebrows slightly darker than my natural ones I ended up with BLACK EYEBROWS. I asked the lady to make them lighter but she kept insisting it was fine although I sensed regret in her voice. Long story short I will not be going there again and I am forced to walk around with light hair and dark eyebrows.Feb 10, 2017AmazingNikaLocation: Surrey Eyes: Blue Skin tone: LightLove that it's: “Quite quick and not too painful”Takes only 15-20 minutes, first time getting my brows waxed let alone tinted and it was easy. My brows look much better and fuller. Will definitely be getting them done here again!Oct 8, 2016I actually have brows now!SkullyLocation: SelinsgroveMy hair is so blonde that it doesn't look like I have any eyebrows unless I fill them in. I just tried tinting for the first time and it has totally changed my routine for the better! I don't have to spend 10-15 minutes on my brows every morning and they look fantastic. I will never go anywhere else for my brows.Sep 25, 2016Fabulous browsSuzy sunshineLocation: Porthcawl Eyes: Blue Skin tone: FairLove that it's: “natural looking”Had my thin, skimpy brows waxed and tinted today. What a result - I now have fuller amazing brows - thankyou BenefitAug 22, 2016This product has flawsEnagelbLocation: Michigan Eyes: Hazel Skin tone: LightI decided to go and get my brows tinted for the first time on my birthday, I was super excited and they looked alright at first, but left a giant dark spot above my eyebrow that won't seem to go away. The level of professionalism is not enough and I wasn't impressed with the person dying my brows attitude either. This service is good in theory, but it did not leave me with a good impression about benefit cosmetics.Feb 16, 2016PerfectNaterzLocation: Belfast Eyes: Green Skin tone: FairLove that it's: “Natural”Had my first eyebrow tint ever today and will definitely be going back. Such a relaxing experience and quick and easy May 8, 2014Gorgeous, Effortless, Stand-Out Brows!8kdinnieneLocation: Roseville, CA, USA Eyes: Blue Skin tone: FairI went with my mom to a boutique in San Francisco to get our brows waxed, a service we'd had done before at our local brow bar. While we were waiting for an aesthetician, we saw that brow tinting was offered and jumped at the chance to try it. Our aesthetician took her time to help us select the right shade and before we new it, our brows were PERFECT! I want my brows to be always tinted! They frame my face so nicely now and really make my blue eyes pop. I highly recommend this service!"
