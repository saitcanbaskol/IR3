Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.Dubrovnik Airport experiences some seasonal variation in the perceived humidity.The muggier period of the year lasts for 3.7 months, from June 8 to September 29, during which time the comfort level is muggy, oppressive, or miserable at least 5% of the time. The muggiest day of the year is August 13, with muggy conditions 19% of the time.The least muggy day of the year is February 27, when muggy conditions are essentially unheard of.Humidity Comfort LevelsThe percentage of time spent at various humidity comfort levels, categorized by dew point: dry < 55°F < comfortable < 60°F < humid < 65°F < muggy < 70°F < oppressive < 75°F < miserable.WindThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.The average hourly wind speed at Dubrovnik Airport experiences significant seasonal variation over the course of the year.The windier part of the year lasts for 6.0 months, from October 16 to April 15, with average wind speeds of more than 8.8 miles per hour.

Based on this score, the best time of year to visit Dubrovnik Airport for general outdoor tourist activities is from late May to early October, with a peak score in the first week of July.Tourism ScoreThe tourism score  (filled area), and its constituents: the temperature score (red line), the cloud cover score (blue line), and the precipitation score (green line).The beach/pool score favors clear, rainless days with perceived temperatures between 75°F and 90°F. Based on this score, the best time of year to visit Dubrovnik Airport for hot-weather activities is from late June to late August, with a peak score in the last week of July.Beach/Pool ScoreThe beach/pool score  (filled area), and its constituents: the temperature score (red line), the cloud cover score (blue line), and the precipitation score (green line).MethodologyFor each hour between 8:00 AM and 9:00 PM of each day in the analysis period (1980 to 2016), independent scores are computed for perceived temperature, cloud cover, and total precipitation. Those scores are combined into a single hourly composite score, which is then aggregated into days, averaged over all the years in the analysis period, and smoothed.Our cloud cover score is 10 for fully clear skies, falling linearly to 9 for mostly clear skies, and to 1 for fully overcast skies.Our precipitation score, which is based on the three-hour precipitation centered on the hour in question, is 10 for no precipitation, falling linearly to 9 for trace precipitation, and to 0 for 0.04 inches of precipitation or more.Our tourism temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 50°F, rising linearly to 9 for 65°F, to 10 for 75°F, falling linearly to 9 for 80°F, and to 1 for 90°F or hotter.Our beach/pool temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 65°F, rising linearly to 9 for 75°F, to 10 for 82°F, falling linearly to 9 for 90°F, and to 1 for 100°F or hotter.Growing SeasonDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).The growing season at Dubrovnik Airport typically lasts for 11 months  ( 333 days ), from around February 4 to around January 3, rarely starting after March 8, or ending before December 10.Time Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing SeasonThe percentage of time spent in various temperature bands: frigid < 15°F < freezing < 32°F < very cold < 45°F < cold < 55°F < cool < 65°F < comfortable < 75°F < warm < 85°F < hot < 95°F < sweltering. The black line is the percentage chance that a given day is within the growing season.Growing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50°F and a cap of 86°F.Based on growing degree days alone, the first spring blooms at Dubrovnik Airport should appear around March 4, only rarely appearing before February 15 or after March 26.Growing Degree DaysThe average growing degree days accumulated over the course of the year, with 25th to 75th and 10th to 90th percentile bands.Solar EnergyThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents.

When available, historical temperature and dew point measurements are taken directly from this weather station. These records are obtained from NOAA's Integrated Surface Hourly data set, falling back on ICAO METAR records as required.In the case of missing or erroneous measurements from this station, we fall back on records from nearby stations, adjusted according to typical seasonal and diurnal intra-station differences. For a given day of the year and hour of the day, the fallback station is selected to minimize the prediction error over the years for which there are measurements for both stations.The stations on which we may fall back are Tivat Airport, Mostar International Airport, Podgorica / Golubovci, Podgorica Airport, Sarajevo Airport, Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza, Ponikve Airport, and Split Airport.Other DataAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Tables of the Sun, Moon and Planets, by Jean Meeus.All other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis. This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.Land Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database, published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.Elevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Names, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database.Time zones for aiports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com.Maps are © Esri, with data from National Geographic, Esri, DeLorme, NAVTEQ, UNEP-WCMC, USGS, NASA, ESA, METI, NRCAN, GEBCO, NOAA, and iPC.DisclaimerThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose.
