They also failed the test solution in the OP and passed in the Freestyle meter. I used 50 strips between the two meters and every one from that batch of test strips failed in the OP. I called OP and after 30 second wait talked to a rep. She said they had some issues with some test strip batches. we did all kinds of testing and they put me in touch with Abbot. Abbot would only replace 100 strips. Ummmm I get a 3 month supply at a time and have 400 of that lot number, still they would only replace 100. I told her to get me someone that could, after a pause she came back and said they will replace 200 test strips, and will bump it up to the ""resolution Dep"" to see if they can replace the other 200. I got a call yesterday and they will replace all the test strips. I have test strips from 3 other batches and all work fine.hitcheca likes this.__________________ I am not a doctor this is what works for me You results may differ11-04-2013, 16:30 # 2ShannySenior MemberJoin Date: Dec 2009Posts: 24,395 Type 2 Diagnosed in 2009 23911 likes received32255 likes givenIs this part of the same issue Tamagno has?

Tamagno's name is John and he is definitely not a 'she'.Tamagno and Mary, like this.11-05-2013, 09:35 # 5TamagnoSenior MemberJoin Date: Sep 2011Location: Connecticut, USAPosts: 2,206 Type 1 Diagnosed in 2011 4235 likes received5260 likes givenI spoke with both Abbott and my endo yesterday. Like you, Chris, Abbott was generous in replacing unusable strips. My endo re-wrote my 'script to read Freestyle ""Regular."" I had been using Freestyle ""Lite"" with absolutely no problem in the old Omnipod system. They work only sporadically in the new system returning ""Error Message 3"" eventually. I'll be getting the Freestyle ""Regular"" strips in a day or two and will let you know the result. Oh, thanks for the correction, Shanny. My recent hospital visit does not appear to have included the rearrangement of any, um, vital parts.Shanny, Mary,, walkerwally1 and 2 others like this.__________________ View Tamagno's full Diabetes Forum profile here .11-05-2013, 12:38 # 6diabetes86Senior MemberJoin Date: Mar 2010Location: MA, USAPosts: 1,475 Type 2 Diagnosed in 1986 895 likes received913 likes givenOk OK SORRY Mr TamangoShanny, Mary, and Freya like this.__________________ I am not a doctor this is what works for me You results may differ11-06-2013, 08:36 # 7TamagnoSenior MemberJoin Date: Sep 2011Location: Connecticut, USAPosts: 2,206 Type 1 Diagnosed in 2011 4235 likes received5260 likes givenIts, okay, diabetes86!
