"Gene Simmons makes joke about infidelity that causes Shannon Tweed to storm off 'Joy Behar Show'BY Shari WeissDAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER Wednesday, June 15, 2011, 12:17 PMfacebook Tweet emailShannon Tweed left her 'Joy Behar Show' interview after a risque comment from Gene Simmons. (HLN)The tension between Gene Simmons and Shannon Tweed boiled over during a recent taping of "" The Joy Behar Show ."" In an interview with the couple airing Wednesday, Behar tried to discuss Simmons' infidelity, but received little response aside from Tweed's disgust. When Behar, somewhat jokingly, asked the 61-year-old KISS bassist how his back is after bedding a reported 5,000 women, he joked right back â€“ much to Tweed's chagrin. ""That's very nice for you to joke about it,"" Tweed said sarcastically. ""F--- off."" The former Playboy Playmate, 54, then took off her microphone and walked off the set. ""Thanks for the question,"" Simmons said to Behar, who seemed shocked that he blamed her for Tweed's frustrations. The couple's marital issues were front and center during the Season 6 premiere of their reality show, "" Gene Simmons Family Jewels ,"" on A&E Tuesday. After 28 years and two children together, Tweed has tired of Simmons' affairs. The ""good news,"" she told Behar, was that they never got married, so a divorce wouldn't be necessary if she did ultimately decide to leave him.But Simmons, despite his obvious discomfort, made clear he doesn't want to split. ""We belong together,"" he said. Behar told Mediaite.com after the interview that she at first thought ""they were kidding"" when the couple talked of their marital problems. ""Then it got tense,"" she said. Staffers said Simmons and Tweed had begun fighting in the green room before the taping started. Behar admitted she left wondering if it was all a ""hoax,"" but Simmons tweeted afterward that it wasn't ""a publicity stunt."" ""Wish I thought of it,"" he wrote. ""VERY REAL on our end."" He also acknowledged that Behar was just doing her job. ""It's business"" for the HLN journalist, he said, ""not personal.""Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emailsprivacy policySend a Letter to the EditorJoin the Conversation: facebook Tweet"
