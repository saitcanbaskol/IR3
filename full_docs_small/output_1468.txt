"BR BriSmy asked onOctober 20, 2013Q: BBC iPlayer wont work since updating to Windows 8.1I'm being asked to update Flash Player by BBC iPlayer, but when I do Windows 8.1 says I don't need it. It won't download anyway. Any ideas, I seem to remember this has happened before.ReplyI have the same question (31)BR BriSmy replied onOctober 22, 2013A:In reply to Srimadhwa B's post on October 21, 2013Thanks for your message. I have had another look at the files involved. I downloaded another browser and made that the default. I uninstalled Flash player plugin version 11. IPlayer stopped working in the new browser too. I went to the Adobe site  and asked for the latest Flash Player (11) and downloaded it. After it was installed I went to the Microsoft IE site and downloaded the latest browser and reinstalled it. I then tried to use iPlayer in Microsoft IE11 and found that it worked. I then uninstalled  the other browser (FireFox) and now only use IE11 as it is my preferred browser. Thank you for all your help Srimadhwa.ReplyDid this solve your problem?YesNo2 people were helped by this replyReplies (11)"
