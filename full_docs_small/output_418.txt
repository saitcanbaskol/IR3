Depending on how cold your fridge is and how the milk was handled, it can last a week or more past the use by date. Take another look at that date, It is NOT an expiration date, it is a use by date. It should also say something about ""will remain wholesome for up to a week after that date"". Keep in mind that food does not spoil according to a calendar date and could just as easily spoil BEFORE the date. Would you drink it anyway if it stunk BEFORE the date? Of course not. Smell and taste. If it doesn't stink and tastes fine, it IS fine.ckngbbbls · 6 years ago2 1 CommentFor the best answers, search on this site https://shorturl.im/dsjxl The thing about expiration dates is that they are kind of arbitrary. There's ""sell by"" dates, ""best by"" dates and ""good before"" dates. Additionally, I've had milk go bad before the expiration date on the carton (and didn't realize it until it was too lake....bad morning...) and I have had it last far past the expiration date. The only real judge of it's being ok to drink is the smell...or what it looks like if you let it sit long enough...gross. Smell it before you drink it. If it smells funny, you should probably toss it, but I've been ok drinking it or cooking with it the same day it starts to smell. When it curdles, then you should throw it out for sure.Maria · 2 years ago1 0 CommentGenerally, under proper refrigeration, dairy products are still good 7-10 days after the expiration dates. The expiration dates are really ""best by"" dates. The food product will not magically spoil when that day occurs. In my house, we drink milk that's a week past prime without giving it another thought. You'll know when milk's gone over because it will be sour tasting and/or lumpy. Even at this point it won't make you sick thanks to the pasteurization process... However, it'll taste all sorts of nasty. So bad, in fact, that you won't go back for another taste. Don't throw the milk away, it's too expensive... If you have a large supply of milk that you can't use up, you can always freeze it. Portion it out into smaller, more manageable containers and freeze. Upon thawing, give it a good shake because the cream will separate, but it's perfectly safe to drink. http://www.stilltasty.com/fooditems/inde...

The milk is still good at least 5-7 days after that date as long as its been refrigerated properly.Tapestry6 · 6 years ago1 1 CommentWe have drunk milk that is around two weeks past its' ""expiration date"" and been fine. Our fridge is very cold, so the milk is neither smelly nor lumpy. Like many are saying here, that date is more for the stores to know when they can't sell it anymore. :) We have noses and eyes, so let's use them and not be wasteful.Sunshine · 3 years ago0 0 CommentWhat redqueen said. My mom and I have used milk that was 5 days past expiration for cooking, so you should be good.Walter · 6 years ago1 0 CommentRedQueen, as usual, is completely right. That is the sell-by date, not the ""magically spoils at midnight"" date. You're fine. You will know when it spoils and even then it most likely won't hurt you. It just tastes gross. You can make ice cream or smoothies out of it. I like to make smoothies and then put the rest into popsicle molds. Don't get bananas involved if you do this. They turn the whole popsicle brown. You might offer it to a neighbor who has kids. It may be appreciated. Kudos for breastfeeding, mama! It's awesome, isn't it? I watched my sister bottlefeed and it is SO much trouble! I nursed all mine. It was challenging at the beginning, but once we figured it out, it was the lazy way to parent!india · 6 years ago3 1 CommentIt should be good still to drink. With milk, go by the smell and if it smells a bit it is best ditched and replaced, although you could probably handle it, the baby may react.H-man · 6 years ago1 0 Comment1 2 nextMaybe you would like to learn more about one of these?Want to build a free website?
