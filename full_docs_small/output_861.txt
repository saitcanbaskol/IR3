"Alternative Titles: Arabic number system, Hindu-Arabic number system, base-10 number systemDecimal number system, also called Hindu-Arabic, or Arabic, number system, in mathematics, positional numeral system employing 10 as the base and requiring 10 different numerals, the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. It also requires a dot (decimal point) to represent decimal fractions. In this scheme, the numerals used in denoting a number take different place values depending upon position. In a base-10 system the number 543.21 represents the sum (5 × 10 2) + (4 × 10 1) + (3 × 10 0) + (2 × 10 −1) + (1 × 10 −2 ). See numerals and numeral systems.This number system, with its associated arithmetic algorithms, has furnished the basis for the development of Western commerce and science since its introduction to the West in the 12th century ad.Learn More in these related articles:numerals and numeral systemsNumerals and numeral systems, symbols and collections of symbols used to represent small numbers, together with systems of rules for representing larger numbers.
