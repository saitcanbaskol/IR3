"Science & Mathematics EngineeringHow much pressure can concrete and steel take?how much pressure can steel withstand? and how much pressure can concrete withstand? per m3 or cm3? thanksFollow 4 answersAnswersRelevanceRatingNewestOldestBest Answer: A common allowable stress for steel is 24,000 psi for A36 steel. Note that allowable stress is a ""working stress"" that is less than ""ultimate stress"" the stress at which the material will ""rupture"". This allowable stress keeps the steel within the ""elastic"" range. Concrete allowable stress is typically around 3000 psi. Concrete, though, being a mixed material has variable values for allowable stress. Reinforced concrete design theory suggests that concrete should not be considered to be able to carry much, if any, tensile force. This explains why you will see steel ""rebar"" or reinforcing bars cast in to the concrete. The steel is there to carry any tensile forces, while the concrete is there to carry compression forces. This is a VERY basic explanation. There are entire books on both of these subjects...Source (s):you don't even want to now my sourcesenterapersonalsnamehahah 路 1 decade ago0 0 CommentYour question is not specific,there are many types of Concrete according to ratio and many types of steel but if want general answer,Concrete is good for compression and for 1:2:4 Cement-Sand-Gravel Ratio up to 4000 psi but very weak in tension where as tor steel is good for tension and is about 70000-80000 psi .shabbir s 路 1 decade ago0 0 CommentNo particular answer because it relies upon on: the width of the wall the scale no matter if the wall itself contributes to the 12tonnes load, yet in ordinary maths, you may have any blend of width as against length: 1m huge by using 2.ninety 4 m lengthy 0.5m huge by using 5.88m lengthy etc etc it isn't so ordinary as this in spite of the indisputable fact that.....for causes said abovedegross 路 1 year ago0 0 CommentAbout all I remember is concrete can stand tremendous compression but almost no stretch .JOHNNIE B 路 1 decade ago0 0 CommentMaybe you would like to learn more about one of these?Want to buy a domain name?
