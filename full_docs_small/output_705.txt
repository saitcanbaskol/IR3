On a PS4 how long does this take to install? An hour ? Two? For a individual game updates & patches, how long do they take to install? Are they relatively the same size as previous gen or are we talking +1 GB for every patch? Thanks in advance.  [Necro-post.

Once that first minute passes by, it's a non-issue. I never even noticed my PS4's disc drive working for more than a few minutes. For patches, that depends on the game. I've just downloaded one for Advanced Warfare that was only 100 or 200 MB. But they can get pretty big.Last edited: Nov 11, 2014MrBeatdown, Nov 11, 2014Last edited by MrBeatdown, Nov 11, 2014DalinarKholin likes this.dolcemagicacastelloStarJoined: Jun 10, 2009Messages: 21,780Location: EarthDate Posted: Nov 11, 2014 #4I installed The Last of Us (44gb) in less than 2 minutes.dolcemagicacastello, Nov 11, 2014DalinarKholin likes this.DrakeisSullyAlmost Not a NoobJoined: Dec 31, 2011Messages: 2,685Date Posted: Nov 11, 2014 #5Hopefully you're not mixing up installing with downloading.

I had 700k for a while back during the early PS3 years and that still worked well enough.MrBeatdown, Nov 11, 2014DalinarKholin likes this.JPeeperAlmost Not a NoobJoined: May 27, 2009Messages: 288Date Posted: Nov 11, 2014 #9Installs of a minute.

I just got my XB1 SO Bundle and dear fucking lord does that thing take forever to download. Yes, I have shit-tastic internet. My PS4 downloaded Destiny in 8 hours (aka while I was at work). On the other hand, it took the XB1 a good FULL 3 days to download MCC. Granted, MCC is bigger so should take longer. But not 3 days longer. It is incredibly frustrating. Funny enough I wouldn't even be complaining if I got my XB1 first because I would have just assumed it was because of my crappy internet. My PS4 spoils me, and it is a big reason why I'm getting my third parties on it (as I would love to go digital despite my shitty internet and that ain't happening on my XB1). As far as installing times. Super quick. Like everyone else has said. I have a few discs because I was afraid of download speeds due to my internet. But then pre-loading happened. Don't have any discs on my XB1 so can't compare.Last edited: Nov 12, 2014Beeeesly, Nov 12, 2014Last edited by Beeeesly, Nov 12, 2014DalinarKholin likes this.BeeeeslyAlmost Not a NoobJoined: Jan 10, 2014Messages: 501Date Posted: Nov 12, 2014 #15DalinarKholin said: ↑DrakeisSully said: ↑Hopefully you're not mixing up installing with downloading.

The installation process begins. In around 1 minute it has loaded the executable and other necessary files to start running the game. For the next 15-20 minutes it's still installing the game in the background as you play it. For the record, the maximum read speed of the PS4 Bluray drive is 27MB per second. For a 40GB game that would require at least 24.7 minutes to read the data under ideal circumstances but since the installation is happening as a background process with data streaming to the actively running game at the same time it can easily take twice that long to complete the full installation.CompletelyAverage, Nov 12, 2014SilverEye1991, jayjayjj50 and DalinarKholin like this.StuDevoNot a weab★Joined: Aug 6, 2008Messages: 81,239Location: Jolly ol' EnglandDate Posted: Nov 12, 2014 #17Is a non issue as you can play the game in a minute or less.

I recall once on PS3 there was this diabolical game called WWE All Stars for installing the ""cache"" every single time you booted the disc. Took 5- 10 mins every time.Last edited: Nov 12, 2014DalinarKholin, Nov 12, 2014Last edited by DalinarKholin, Nov 12, 2014SillyRabbit18Almost Not a NoobJoined: Jan 22, 2014Messages: 3,977Location:I be stylin on you hatersDate Posted: Nov 12, 2014 #21I downloaded CoD and it took me and hour.
