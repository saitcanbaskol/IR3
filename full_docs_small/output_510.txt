All of our producers are fully informed about the strict criteria necessary to participate in our program. They are dedicated to doing all that they can to produce a quality product for you.To ensure transparency in our retail labeling, we comply with USDA Country-of-Origin Labeling (COOL). Our labels will specify Product of USA since all of the cattle that enter our program are all born in the USA. All of our beef comes from a USDA inspected facility located in Texas and meets our strict standards quality and food safety.The topic of labeling is a confusing one for many consumers. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have further questions or concerns.Back to TopHas Nolan Ryan’s Beef been affected in recent ground beef recalls?No. None of Nolan Ryan’s Beef was involved in recent recalls of ground beef. Our beef is produced in a close-loop system that does not involve companies that have been included in the recalls. The closed-loop system allows us to isolate our beef and ensure strict food safety protocols are followed. We work closely with our processing partners in all areas of animal handling, food safety and quality control to ensure we provide only the best beef possible. Testing is only one part of our food safety program. Safe handling must continue once the beef reaches the grocery store to ensure that spoilage and contamination does not occur. The same holds true once the beef arrives in your home. It’s important that consumers handle raw meats properly and use good food safety practices at home. Hand washing, keeping raw and cooked foods separated, and ensuring proper cooking temperatures is critical. Ground beef should always be cooked thoroughly and at least to 160 degrees internal temperature. If you have additional questions, please email us.Back to TopHow does Nolan Ryan’s Beef ensure safe handling of cattle?Our company was founded on the principle of providing the very best beef to the consumer. We know we can only do this if we give the greatest care to our animals. The Ryan family and the other ranching families who started the company are committed to this industry. Not only do we monitor the feedyards where our cattle are fed, but we partner with processors who share our same values and commitment to quality and safety. Every year the feedyards voluntarily have their facilities audited by an independent third party for both animal welfare and food safety. We are working together to make sure the beef we provide has been handled with the utmost care, is safe and nutritious.Back to TopWhere did the idea for Nolan Ryan’s Beef come from?From Nolan Ryan, baseball legend and rancher. Even during his baseball career, Nolan was an active member of several beef industry organizations. He and several like-minded ranchers decided something had to be done about the consistency of beef. They partnered with some of the leading meat experts who understand the science of beef quality and tenderness to develop the program. Nolan Ryan’s Guaranteed Tender is an operation of Beefmaster Cattlemen, LP which is owned and operated by cattlemen.Back to TopDo you use imported beef?We do not use any meat product imported from other countries for our whole muscle or ground products. Cattle in our program are born in the USA, as well as raised and processed in Texas.Back to TopHow long do you age your beef?Our Guaranteed Tender beef is “wet aged” for a minimum of 14 days. “Wet aged” means that each major wholesale cut is aged in a vacuum package in a cooler at a temperature of 33º F to 34º F. Our aged beef does not enter the retail supply with any more than 21 days of age. USDA certifies our tenderness program.Back to TopWhat does “Guaranteed Tender” mean?All-Natural Guaranteed Tender Beef means the product meets the USDA definition of All-Natural. This means that the product is minimally processed with no artificial ingredients added. In addition, the cattle do not receive any added growth hormones or antibiotics within 100 days of harvest and the beef is tested for antibiotic residue. These restrictions and controls are added to what occurs in commodity beef.When Nolan started this brand, his biggest frustration with beef was inconsistency. For a man known for integrity and consistency, he made it his mission to give consumers a great eating experience, every time! For beef lovers, there’s nothing better than a tender, melt-in-your-mouth steak with robust, beefy flavor. This is so important to Nolan that he personally guarantees it. If we don’t measure up to your expectations, we’ll give you a full refund of your purchase price. In addition to our Guaranteed Tender Beef, we also produce our All-Natural Grass-Fed.Back to TopDo the cattle receive added growth hormones or antibiotics?Our Guaranteed Tender cattle do not receive growth hormone implants of any kind within 100 days of harvest which far exceeds FDA withdrawal guidelines. Our Grass- Fed cattle never receive antibiotics or added hormones.All of our cattle are fed only in licensed feed yards that have agreed to meet this specification. We personally monitor these feed yards on a regular basis to review their records and ensure compliance with our high standards. An independent ISO-certified Food Safety Lab randomly tests our product each week for antibiotic residue. We have never had a positive reaction, but any beef showing a positive can be removed from the system before it arrives at the retail store, restaurant or our online shipping cooler. But not using antibiotics doesn’t mean that we would neglect a sick animal. Horse-back riders monitor the health and comfort of our cattle on a daily basis. Sick animals are cared for and treated but that animal is eliminated from our program.Back to TopShould I be concerned about “Mad Cow” Disease?Cattle produced for Nolan Ryan’s All-Natural beef never consume bovine muscle, nerve, or bone tissue of any kind (the practice believed to have caused “Mad Cow” Disease in Europe).Back to TopWhat about Foot and Mouth Disease?Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) only affects animals with cloven hooves, not humans. The disease does not kill cattle, but leaves them sick and non-productive. The disease is highly contagious, which is the reason there are restrictions on the importation of beef from diseased countries and on travel within those countries. Currently the U.S. is free of FMD. Although an infection of the disease would be a horrible calamity for beef producers, it would not affect the safety of the beef supply. Again, FMD does not affect humans.Back to Top"
