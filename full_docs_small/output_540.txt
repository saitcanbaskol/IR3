I was on oring monkey and just a bit confused as to which ones are usable and which aren't. are the Buna quad's better to use then the standard buna's?Last edited by L3G0 : 04-18-2012 at 10:29 PM .Sponsored Links Remove AdvertisementPbNation.comAdvertisement04-19-2012, 02:29 AM # 2NexxuxSquish SquishJoin Date: Oct 2009Location: ***502***Feedback: 43 /0/ 0buna, viton and hnbr are just different materials used to make orings. typically, buna's wear out quicker. but are much cheaper. hnbr orings are 70's (which is the hardness or rigidness of the oring, the higher the harder :-) ). and are green. last longer than bunas. buna can come in 70 or 90. and are typically black.. viton can come in 75 or 90. and are typically brown. these are the most expensive orings, and last longer than bunas as well. the higher the number the tighter the fit usually as well. but you can use any of them for just about any oring in your marker. all that matters is if it is the appropriate fitment. quad orings aren't recommend for most paintball markers. i never use them atleast. they are slightly different in design than other orings. they are in the shape of and X rather than round. they also are better at preventing twisting in the grove they sit because of this design.__________________ "" Mess with the best, Die like the rest ""Main: Vader Black Vanquish 1.5 - Rotor v3 - Ninja Pro 68/45Backup: Dust Black Axe - Rotor v3 - Ninja Pro 68/45Pump: Stormtrooper Empire SniperLast edited by Nexxux : 04-19-2012 at 02:37 AM .04-19-2012, 09:26 AM # 3KazerJoin Date: Jun 2002Location: Central CaliforniaFeedback: 10 /0/ 0I tried some quad O-rings in a couple of markers before and they didn't seem to do anything special for them and were a total pain to deal with.

And all bunas in my luxe except for when I need a tighter fit...I use vitons. For my 3rd inner can oring.__________________ "" Mess with the best, Die like the rest ""Main: Vader Black Vanquish 1.5 - Rotor v3 - Ninja Pro 68/45Backup: Dust Black Axe - Rotor v3 - Ninja Pro 68/45Pump: Stormtrooper Empire Sniper"
