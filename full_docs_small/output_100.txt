"Supertramp The Logical Song without Cofounder Roger Hodgsongoer4everSubscribe 2.3KAdd toShareMore2,907,690 views4,665543Published on Apr 22, 2010Supertramp performs The Logical Song without lead singer, songwriter Roger Hodgson. The Logical Song was written by Roger Hodgson who won the Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters for this song. Roger and Rick wrote separately and the songs they sung on the albums were the songs they wrote. Roger Hodgson is also known as the voice of Supertramp and the majority of songs Roger wrote like Dreamer, Breakfast in America, Give a Little Bit, Take the Long Way Home and so many others.. When Roger left the band Rick Davies got the rights to the name Supertramp and Roger Hodgson got his songs. Supertramp isn't touring anymore - although on a better note, singer-songwriter and co-founder of the band, Roger Hodgson is playing shows all over the world on his Breakfast in America Tour, backed by a talented and close-knit band! Fans haven't been happier to experience the magic and magnificence of the songs they grew up with, from the tunesmith that composed them from his very own heart and life experiences. And for Roger's latest concert schedule, go to his tour page to book your tickets and don't miss out -- http://www.rogerhodgson.com/documents... Roger sounds even better today. I feel he sings from his heart and soul and that touches me when I hear him sing. He has a way of sharing his music that I find profound and touching. Another artist who is similar is John Fogerty of Credence Clearwater Revival. I love to hear John sing his songs and there's no comparison for me when I hear the band Credence Clearwater Revisited sing John's songs. The bands Supertamp and Credence Clearwater Revisited just don't sound like the real deal. And many have commented you prefer hearing Roger sing his own songs and I would like to hear others thoughts on this. Please post your comments on this video.
