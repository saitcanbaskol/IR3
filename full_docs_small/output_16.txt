"Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding in Midlife and BeyondOverviewWomen of any age can have abnormal vaginal bleeding (irregular menstrual periods). Abnormal bleeding can also come from the uterus and other organs in the pelvis.During midlife, women’s hormone levels slowly decrease. This normal change can cause irregular bleeding. Usually this type of bleeding stops around the time a woman has her final period (menopause).Abnormal vaginal bleeding can also be caused by:Infection of the vagina or uterusUrinary tract infectionOther medical conditionsUterine fibroidsGrowths in the pelvic organs, including cancerAlso, some medications may affect vaginal bleeding.Call us to schedule an exam if you have vaginal bleeding that:Is heavier or lasts longer than usual.Occurs after you’ve completed menopause (12 months of no periods).Treatment is based on the cause of your vaginal bleeding. It may include medication, nonsurgical procedures, and surgery.CausesChanges in your bleeding patterns are normal during midlife stages.PerimenopausePerimenopause is the time period before your menstrual cycle ends. Usually it begins several years before menopause. For some women, it starts as early as their mid-30s or early 40s. There’s no way to tell how long perimenopause will last.You may be in perimenopause if your periods are:Irregular, with longer or shorter cycles (time between periods).Lighter or heavier than has been usual for you.Irregular periods occur when you’re no longer ovulating (releasing an egg) every month.MenopauseWhen you have not had a menstrual period for 12 months in a row, you’ve completed menopause.Menopause usually happens several years after you first have perimenopause symptoms.If you have vaginal bleeding after menopause, call us to schedule an exam.Symptoms and DiagnosisUnusual bleeding from the uterus that is not due to growths (fibroids or polyps) is called dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB).Bleeding can be heavy or light. During perimenopause, it’s usually due to natural changes, including:Changes in hormone levelsNo ovulation (anovulation)To find out what’s causing DUB, we may:Perform a pelvic exam.Do blood and urine tests.Check a tissue sample (biopsy).Related ConditionsAbnormal bleeding can also result from this range of medical conditions.Infections of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries can include:Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)Genital warts on the vulva or in the vaginaUrinary tract infection (UTI) can cause bleeding from the bladder.

The pituitary gland at the base of your brain produces hormones, including prolactin.Cushing’s syndrome is caused by a growth in the pituitary gland. It causes high levels of cortisol in the blood. Cortisol is a hormone that helps your body respond to stress.Vaginal dryness, a common symptom of menopause, can cause bleeding during sex with intercourse.Other CausesGrowths in one of the pelvic organs can cause unusual bleeding.Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths in the wall of the uterus. Fibroids can be as small as a seed or as large as a grapefruit. They can grow as a single tumor or in several places.Women are most likely to have fibroids in midlife. Sometimes they occur in younger women.Fibroids may cause no symptoms.
