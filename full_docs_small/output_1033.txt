His nightclub is finally about to open but Tommy is barely speaking to him since he revealed his secret identity. To his surprise, Helena Bertinelli aka The Huntress has suddenly re-appeared intent on killing her crime boss father. As far as Oliver is concerned, he's in prison where he belongs but Helena has learned that he is to be released for assisting the police in their investigation of other mobsters and will soon disappear into the witness protection program. Oliver initially refuses to help her but she makes it clear she will not hesitate to kill someone close to him if he doesn't help. Meanwhile, Laurel's mother Dinah has returned with a theory that her other daughter might still be alive.
