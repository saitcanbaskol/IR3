Like broadcast technicians, they need an associate's degree. The equipment they work on would include the equipment used by recording arts professionals, which means they need to know how to set it up and operate it and how this equipment would ideally function.Electrical and electronics installers and repairers also perform some tasks that are similar to recording arts professionals. They install electronic equipment and they may perform repairs on electrical systems and cables when the equipment isn't working properly.
