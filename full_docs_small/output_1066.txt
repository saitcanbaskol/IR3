Blitz - a food processer will give the best results. Remove the outer leaves from the cauliflower, cut it into quarters and remove most of the thick core, then cut each quarter into two or three chunks. You don’t want to overload the blender, or it will struggle to blitz the cauliflower, instead work with about half the cauliflower at a time. Blend for 30 seconds or so, until the cauliflower resembles fine rice, or couscous.You can also... Grate - If you don’t own a food processer, you can grate the raw cauliflower on the coarse side of the grater. You may find you’re left with a few bigger pieces, which will give the ‘rice’ a chunkier texture.How to storeOnce the cauliflower is prepared, you can store it until you’re ready to use. If you’re following a calorie-controlled diet, divide the cauliflower rice into 100g portions, which contain just 25 calories each, and stash in the fridge for up to three days, or in the freezer for two months. The ‘rice’ can be microwaved from frozen, or defrosted before stir-frying or microwaving.How to cookWe tested three different ways to cook cauliflower rice, to discover our favourite. Make sure you season with salt after cooking, if you season before the rice can become waterlogged and soggy.MicrowavingBy far the easiest way to cook your cauliflower rice, and as you don’t need to add any fat, the healthiest too. Microwave fresh cauliflower rice in a heatproof bowl, covered with cling film, for three minutes on High. If using from the freezer, microwave for four minutes on High, mixing the ‘rice’ half way through cooking. This method gives the rice a nice, neutral flavour, perfect for serving with a curry or tagine.Our verdict:Flavour 5/10Ease 10/10Senior food editor, Barney says: ‘'I think this method would enable me to pass the cauliflower rice off as regular rice or couscous to my kids. I’d serve it with their favourite curry, a creamy korma .’'Stir-fryingWe stir-fried our cauliflower rice in a little olive oil, for 5 minutes. Although we found this gave it a lovely, nutty flavour and colour, the texture was less pleasing. We were left with soggy cauliflower rice, which clumped together in places.Our verdict:Flavour rating 7/10Ease 6/10Assistant food editor, Miriam says: ‘'This would be perfect for making cauliflower sushi with, as it clumps together well if you squeeze it in the palm of your hand.’'RoastingThis was our favourite method of cooking. We tossed the rice in a drizzle of olive oil in a tray, then spread it out to a thin, even layer. We then roasted the ‘rice’ at 200C for 12 minutes, mixing it in the tray halfway through cooking. This dried the rice out, giving it a light, fluffy texture and intensified the flavour.Our verdict:Flavour 10/10Ease 5/10Food editor, Cassie says: '‘Next time I’d add some ground cumin, chilli and coriander to the ‘rice’ before cooking, and toss through some chopped mint and parsley once it’s out of the oven. It would be lovely with some lamb chops and a dollop of yogurt.''Test out these tasty recipes with our how to make cauliflower rice video.Have you tried making cauliflower rice?

I use smoked mackerel and mushrooms and any other veg I fancy. Delicious and low in carbs.Sandrita2nd Feb, 2017The Cauliflower rice works really well for me simple by stir frying with other ingredients- fabulous idea and very quick and easy!barleybird24th Jun, 2016I have made cauliflower rice several times, always using the microoven. Now having tried your recommended roasting method, I am absolutely delighted. Perfect and appetizing structure, wonderful flavour, easily mixed with veggies (as I did, a lot). I hardly can't wait to make it again. (Are you on 5:2? It makes a phenomenal ""2-day""-dish!)stokeysue20th May, 2016I cook it in the microwave, but in a microwave steamer rather than just in a bowl, think it gives a better texture Just me think 100g is rather a mean portion?garringtonsharon8th May, 2016I don't recommend defrosting frozen ""rice"" before cooking I did a batch and it turned greyish brown and wet - looked so unappetizing I threw it away. The second frozen batch I tipped straight into a wok which had some lightly fried peppers,courgettes and peas in it. I pushed this to one side of the pan and fried off one beaten egg in the other side which was then chopped and mixed into the vegetables to make a lovely egg fried rice, with some soy sauce to season.TawaDul28th Apr, 2016I tried Cauliflower Rice for dinner today. I was totally impressed and determined to make it again. I added matchstick carrots and onions to the food processor with the raw cauliflower. I also added Montreal Steak Seasoning and a touch of Olive Oil. Cooked for 12 minutes - stirring half-way through. Turned out great! This is a keeper.Kirk_S21st Feb, 2016How does roasting get difficulty of 5/10?! Couldn't be any easier!juliafrancis13th Nov, 2015I added authentic Spanish paella seasoning & then stirred in peppers onions & prawns like a paella ! No one realised until I told them! Xisobelmoore12th Nov, 2015Please could Good Food drop the ""fat is unhealthy"" line now? Adding olive oil doesn't make this unhealthy, far from it. Carbs need to be replaced with something!janetleeke30th Oct, 2015I roasted mine with garlic and ginger and it was nice. Even better though was when I stir fried it in butter (plus a bit of olive oil), with cashew nuts, a few basil leaves, chilli, ginger, garlic and some left over salsa. I served it with prawns - delicious!1 2 next ›"
