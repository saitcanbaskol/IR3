"Longitude Latitude Geographic Coordinate System Altitude Geolocation GeographyWhat is the difference between latitude, longitude and altitude?26 AnswersXavier Daull, studied at National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts , FranceAnswered Dec 20, 2015Originally Answered: What is the difference between latitude and longitude?Longitude and latitude are like X/Y coordinates (absciss, ordinate) but on the Earth sphere. So any place on Earth can be pinpointed using its latitude (North/South value) and longitude (West/East value) coordinates.A point's coordinate is measured in degrees because it is the angle betwheen the agreed reference (Equator for latitude / Greenwich for longitude) and this point, viewed from the center of Earth.http://modernsurvivalblog.com/wp...Latitude: it is the North/South value of a point on Earth. Any point on the Equator's circle is of latitude 0°, the top north is 90° North, the top south is 90° South. Circles parallels to the Equator are of the same latitude.Longitude: it is the West/East value of a point on Earth. Longitudes are lines going from south pole to north pole. Greenwich is on longitude 0° and any point on the line going from North pole to the South pole via Greenwich is on longitude 0°.Latitudes and longitudes are perpandicular each other on the famous Mercator projection (an earth projection is a way of drawing a sphere on a flat map):Eiffel tour latitude is 48° North (from Equator) and its longitude is 02° East (from Greenwich). To be more accurate we usually use seconds (') and minutes ('') so Eiffel tour is: 48° 51' 30"" North, 02° 17' 40"" East.79.3k Views · View UpvotersYour response is private.Is this answer still relevant and up to date?Related Questions More Answers BelowHow does latitude differ from altitude?What are the similarities between lines of longitude and latitude?In the form of table, what is the difference between longitude and latitude?What are two cities which are on the same longitude but on different latitudes?What is the difference of longitude and latitude?Ask New QuestionShivani Chaturvedi, Research Fellow at Central Institute of Mining and Fuel ResearchUpdated Dec 12, 2015 · Author has 61 answers and 132.8k answer viewsOriginally Answered: What is the difference between latitude and longitude?Latitudes also known as parallels of latitude and meridians also known as meridians of longitude are the imaginary lines that run on the earth's surface which are used to find the exact location of a place on the globe (or map) and it's time zone.Parallels of latitude:These lines circle the earth from north pole and south pole.Equator is the longest latitude which divides the earth between northern hemisphere and southern hemispher. These are measured in degrees.Equator is latitude of 0°. The latitudes in the north area numbered with °N with it. The latitudes in the south are numbered with °S with it. Latitudes are from 0° to 90° N and 0° to 90°S. Latitudes are not of the same length.Other important latitudes are Tropic of cancer at 23.5°N, Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5°S,Article circle at 66.5°N, Antarctic circle 66.5°S, North pole 90°N, South pole at 90°S.Meridians of longitude:These lines are drawn joining north pole and south pole. Unlike latitudes, longitudes are of same length.These are measured in °W or°E.Prime meridian is the most important longitude at 0°. This longitude divides the earth in eastern hemisphere and western hemisphere.The lines lying on the east of prime meridian are named as °E and those to the west of prime meridian are measured as °W. There are 360 longitudes. But 180°E and 180°W are not the same lines.Longitudes along with helping in finding location also helps to know the time zone. For each meridian you travel, the time differs by 4 minutes.So, once you know the latitude and longitude of a place you can easily locate it on globe or map!30.3k Views · View UpvotersYour response is private.Is this answer still relevant and up to date?Neeraj Patralekh, Another Engineer, Quora loverUpdated Mar 19, 2018Latitude and Longitude is nothing but a coordinate system. Let's discuss one by one.What is coordinate system.Location of an object can't be decided unless we take any reference point. Suppose two person stand on a ground we can't say what is their position if we don't measure distance from any other point.Basically there are two type of coordinate system first one 2D like on a piece of paper we draw some point.Here any point is defined as position from X-axis and Y-axis.And other one is 3D like a point inside a roomBut what if we want to get location of any object on Earth's surface.We can't use 2D or 3D Co-ordinate system because earth is neither a flat nor in a cubical shape.Earth is a spherical in shape, so in order to get a position on earth we have find a different co-ordinate system.In this geographical co-ordinate system X-axis will replace Latitude and Y-axis will replace Longitude.Now from above this image we can defineLatitude are those imaginary line which are parallel to Equatorial and Longitude are those imaginary line which are perpendicular to Latitude.There is another significance of these line Latitude explain the temperature range on Earth and Longitude explain Time zone.Now finally your third question what is altitude.Altitude is height or distance of an object from sea level.1.2k Views · View UpvotersShailesh Latkar, Geography optional in CSEAnswered Feb 8, 2017 · Author has 105 answers and 89.9k answer viewsIn lay man terms :Latitudes are the horizontal lines which demarcates earth's climatic variations for eg. 0° to 30°N S latitude roughly its equator the temperate the torrid then frigid zones .Longitude are vertical lines which demarcates time zones because of apparent movement of earth ,so at every longitude there's a time difference of 4 minutes as 360° earth divided by 24hrs .Longitude and latitude together are useful for specifying location and its various attributes.Altitude is the distance measured from Mean Sea Level vertically upwards . For eg. If im at the peak of everest then i m at 8848 altitude meaning m 8.8 km above sea level , Here sea level is taken as a base voz its equal throughout the globe.Trick if you can't remember these is , its made by me so its helps me you can make your own .I m Latkar n m lazy to mai humesha sota reheta hoo ,to Lat means latitude and sote hum horizontal hai na.Long time no see my gf always say as we are in distance relationship.

What is the difference between them?You can get lots of good answers for this question by posting it in any search engine on the internet. A good answer is here.The following picture shows latitudes and longitudes on the earth’s surface a little better. ( www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/images/globe6.jpg)The differences you can see in the picture.Longitude circles follow the earth’s circumference from North to South and they are all the same size as the earth’s circumference. They are all centered on the center of the earth and they converge towards the poles. Their planes are all parallel to the earth’s rotation axis and contain the rotation axis.Latitude circles are drawn in an East-West direction and they are all parallel to the equator, which is a circle along the circumference of the earth with the earth’s center as its center. The plane of the equator is perpendicular to the rotation axis of the earth and so are the planes of all the latitude circles. The equator is the largest latitude circle and all the other latitude circles get smaller towards the poles. because their centers are on the rotation axis and not at the center of the earth.The units are in angular units, normally degrees, at the center of the earth. The angles for latitude refer to the plane of the equator, North or South, while the angles for longitude refer to the plane of the zero longitude, which is very close to the Greenwich longitude.Longitudes are also referred to as Meridians and latitudes as parallels.5k Views · View UpvotersDeepak Kumar, works at Maruti Suzuki India LimitedAnswered Mar 10, 2018Originally Answered: What is the difference between longitude, latitude and altitude?Longitude connects North pole to South pole , by convention , line passes through GREENWICH is accepted as 0 degree meridian & others places longitude is measured w.r.t prime meridian east or west.Range of longitude is 180 degree eastward or -180 degree westward.While latitude specifies the north/South position of a point on the earth.

This is ussually determined with an altimeter which works the same as an annoroid barometer. Indeed barometric pressure is entered into the altimeter so it will compensate for error caused by weather related variances in air pressure.445 ViewsAlan Willoughby, former Maths Teacher, Earth Scientist, Natural Therapist, (1974-2016)Answered Nov 27, 2017 · Author has 843 answers and 93.7k answer viewsOriginally Answered: What is the comparison of latitude and longitude?Exactly the same as is shown by the two sides of a right angled triangle that form the right angle.Both latitude and longitude are imaginary lines drawn around the earth based on an arbitrary system where zero line of longitude passes through Greenwich, England, and runs north to south (or vice versa), and zero line of latitude passes around the center of the earth (so is the longest line of latitude) running from east to west (or vice versa) and is called the equator. Subsequent lines of longitude are labelled in degrees west or east from the line through Greenwich, based on an imaginary protractor set horizontally east to west through the center of the earth. Subsequent lines of latitude are labelled in degrees from the equator based on an imaginary protractor set through the center of the earth between north and south poles.Lines of latitude and longitude intersect at 90 degrees because that is the angle at which east-west lines intersect with north-south lines.231 ViewsPrabh Rangi, Independent Dharmic Peace Researcher (2018-present)Answered Jan 23, 2018Originally Answered: What is the difference between latitude and longitude?latitude is east-west longitude is north-south Equator is centre - and divides world into Southern and Northern Hemispheres.
