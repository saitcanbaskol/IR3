The song is framed by studio singers singing ""Who is it?/Who is it?/Who guards the front door whenever he can?/ Who is it?/Who is it?/ (Intercom sound, Music's speaking voice distorted as if coming through the intercom) ""Hello, this is Carlton, your doorman"". This is followed by Music as Carlton, speaking in character in rhyme, with the pattern repeated a few times till the end when he says, ""So long, this was Carlton, Your Doorman.""

Add the first question.User ReviewsThe Quiet Gem8 June 2006 | by SoSingular – See all my reviewsThis show is ground-breaking and paved the way for many shows to come. Before Friends and Seinfeld, this was the show about singles living in New York City. This show portrayed the Jewish-American culture in a positive light. The chemistry between Valerie Harper, Julie Kavner, and Nancy Walker is among the best that television has ever seen. And, while always funny, it was constantly breaking its premise in half and yet still staying funny and great. I love, too, how it is the first great sitcom that used self-deprecation as a tool to provide humor and portray grand humanity. Both Harper and Kavner (Marge Simpson of The Simpsons) belong in the Television Hall of Hame based simply on this wonderful show.14 of 15 people found this review helpful.
