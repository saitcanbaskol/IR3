Beneath the membrane is a stroma of collagenous tissue containing yellow elastic fibers. The pleura divides into thevisceral pleura, which covers the lung, dipping into the fissures between the lobes, and theparietal pleura, which lines the chest wall, covers the diaphragm, and reflects over the structures in the mediastinum. The parietal and visceral pleurae are separated from each other by a smallamount of fluid that acts as a lubricant as the lungs expand and contract during respiration.

The pleurae are moistened with a serous secretion that reduces friction duringrespiratory movements of the lungs. See:pleural effusion; mediastinum; thorax; illustrationcostal pleuraParietal pleura.pleura diaphragmaticaThe part of the pleura covering the upper surface of the diaphragm.mediastinal pleuraThe portion of the parietal pleura that extends to cover the mediastinum.parietal pleuraThe serous membrane that lines the chest cavity; it extends from the mediastinal roots of the lungsand covers the sides of the pericardium to the chest wall and backward to the spine. The visceraland parietal pleural layers are separated only by a lubricating secretion. These layers may becomeadherent or separated by air or by blood, pus, or other fluids, when the lungs or chest wall areinjured or inflamed.Synonym: costal pleurapleura pericardiacaThe portion of the pleura covering the pericardium.pleura pulmonalisVisceral pleura.visceral pleuraThe pleura that covers the lungs and enters into and lines the interlobar fissures. It is loose at thebase and at the sternal and vertebral borders to allow for lung expansion.Medical Dictionary, © 2009 Farlex and PartnerspleuraThe thin, double-layered membrane that separated the lungs from the inside of thechest wall. The inner layer is attached to the lung and the outer to the inside of the chest cavity. A film of fluid between the two layers provides lubrication to allow smooth movement during breathing.Collins Dictionary of Medicine © Robert M.

The outer layer, the parietal pleura encases thediaphragm and lines the wall of the chest. The inner layer, the visceral pleura, encases thelungs. Minute amounts of fluid are present between the two layers and serve as a lubricantwhile the lungs contract and expand during respiration.Jonas: Mosby's Dictionary of Complementary and Alternative Medicine.
