"05/10/2013 by adminOne Of The Best Herbs To Stop Heavy Bleeding With Fibroids Is CinnamonHeavy bleeding is one of the symptoms of having certain types of fibroids. The bleeding can be so severe that it depletes the body of iron leading to anemia which can be life threatening if not treated promptly. If you suffer from heavy bleeding associated with fibroids, there are many ways that are effective for the natural treatment of uterine fibroids including the use of herbs.There are a number of herbs that can be used to treat this symptom including yarrow, red raspberry, shepherd’s purse, lady’s mantle, cranesbill, etc. If you cannot get your hands on these herbs, you can easily reach into your kitchen cabinet and use cinnamon which is also another of the effective herbs used to stop heavy bleeding with fibroids.Why Do Fibroids Cause Bleeding?About 30 percent of women who have uterine fibroids will experience heavy bleeding or irregular bleeding.A lot of this heavy bleeding is blamed on submucosal (submucous) fibroids that grow just under the uterus lining. This is one of the less common types of fibroids but since they are so close to the lining of the uterus (endometrium or mucosa), they affect the blood vessels in the uterine lining causing prolonged and/or heavy bleeding.Submucosal fibroids lead to heavy bleeding when they prevent the uterus from being able to close the blood vessels around the uterus due to the location of this type of tumor.Intramural fibroid tumors that grow within the muscular walls of the uterus may also cause heavy bleeding as they increase in number or size. This type of fibroid tumor is the most common and usually does not produce any symptoms or cause any problems unless as mentioned previously, they increase in size and number.Heavy bleeding from intramural fibroids results when these tumors within the uterine wall interfere with the normal rhythmic uterine contractions and prevent the uterus from closing the blood vessels in the uterine lining as is normal when these tumors are not present in the uterine wall or when the fibroids are harmless and symptom free which occurs only when they are located away from the uterine cavity.While submucosal and intramural fibroids are commonly to blame for causing heavy bleeding, other types of fibroids may also cause excessive blood loss.By their nature, fibroid tumors require a heavy blood supply to grow. This causes blood vessels to expand with the increased need by fibroids for blood. With more blood coming to the uterus area, heavy bleeding may result.Some of the indications that you have excessive bleeding associated with fibroids include;The need to use two tampons or two pads at the same time or saturating a pad or tampon within an hour.Flooding leading to accidents resulting in embarrassing stained clothing.Needing to wear adult diapers in order to comfortably contain the excessive blood flow.Needing to get up at night frequently in order to change the pad or tampon while also still having accidents resulting in stained bedclothes.Needing to also change your social schedule as well as work commitments due to this heavy menstrual cycle.In addition, you will experience heavy blood loss if your menstrual cycle lasts for at least a week and/or occurs more frequently than every 21 days and if you bleed between periods.Heavy Bleeding and AnemiaIf you are experiencing any of the above or other irregularities signifying heavy blood loss, this could create a state of anemia since you are losing too many red blood cells with the heavy blood loss. This condition could become fatal if the excessive bleeding is not controlled. Heavy blood loss can also lead to dizziness and weakness.Heavy and prolonged bleeding is one of the main reasons that hysterectomies are performed each year. Before taking such a drastic step, it is important to remember that heavy and prolonged bleeding can be controlled naturally including with the use of certain herbs such as cinnamon.An anemic state results because heavy blood loss leads to the body not having enough iron due to the loss of iron that is normally carried in red blood cells.The heavy bleeding is not usually sudden. It will usually build gradually over several months.When in an anemic state, there will be less oxygen being carried by the red blood cells to vital organs. With less oxygen reaching vital organs such as the brain, you may experience fatigue, shortening of breath, ringing in the ears, light headedness, headaches, dizziness, etc. At worst, heart failure or heart attack may occur.Cinnamon For Fibroid BleedingWhy Cinnamon?Cinnamon which is also known as cassia, Saigon cinnamon or Ceylon cinnamon is a common spice used in the home but it is also one of the oldest natural healers known to man and is commonly recommended by various herbalists for the treatment of various health conditions including;Pain, due to the antimicrobial properties found in cinnamon through the action of eugenol which is a natural anesthetic oil found in this herb.To treat infections which is one of the reasons that cinnamon is commonly included in toothpaste and dental floss.
