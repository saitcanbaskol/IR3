Each unit contains twelve 10 kWrectifiers (the same “charger” that is found in Model S) giving a total of 120kW DC per pair of pods. Each pod feeds DC power at c. 400V/300A into the Model S battery via a cable plugged into the rear of the car. It is intended that Superchargers will be fed from solar power supplied from a canopy over the Supercharger station, but these are not being installed yet in an effort to simplify and accelerate the Supercharger build out.7.9k Views · View UpvotersYour response is private.Is this answer still relevant and up to date?"
