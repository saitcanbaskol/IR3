I use Windows Explorer (sometimes) to upload new files to my web servers but I do not ever use IE (Internet Explorer). I wasn't coming up with any valid solutions on this topic so I tried some things of my own. Long story, short: go into Internet Explorer and clear the history including passwords. Since I don't use IE, I cleared everything... cache, cookies, passwords, etc. Clearing out IE cleared out Windows Explorer and I was able to input new usernames and passwords.share improve this answeredited Sep 27 '12 at 22:23Tom Wijsman48.8k 22 157 239answered Aug 16 '12 at 19:26Samantha11 1add a commentYour AnswerSign up or log inSign up using GoogleSign up using FacebookSign up using Email and PasswordPost as a guestNameEmailBy posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.Not the answer you're looking for?
