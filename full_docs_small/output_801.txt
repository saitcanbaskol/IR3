Everyone knows that. Everyone knows that Nicklaus holds the all-time record with 18 wins in majors.But almost everyone underrates how good Nicklaus was in the majors. How can that be, when - as just noted - every golf fan knows Nicklaus holds the record for wins? Well, just take a look at Nicklaus' accomplishments in the majors, outlined here and on the following few pages, and you'll be astounded at just how good the Golden Bear was in the biggest tournaments.We'll start with the basics, running down Nicklaus' list of major wins.Nicklaus' 18 Majors in Chronological Order1962 U.S. Open: Nicklaus' first major came via an 18-hole playoff win over Arnold Palmer, 71 to 74.1963 Masters: Won by one shot over Tony Lema.1963 PGA Championship: Won by two strokes over Dave Ragan.1965 Masters: Set records for the score (271 - since bettered) and margin of victory, finished 9 shots ahead of runners-up Palmer and Gary Player.1966 Masters: Shot 70 in an 18-hole playoff to defeat Tommy Jacobs (72) and Gay Brewer 78). Became first back-to-back Masters champ.1966 British Open: Beat runners-up Doug Sanders and Dave Thomas by one shot.1967 U.S. Open: Won by four strokes over Palmer.1970 British Open: Defeated Sanders in an 18-hole playoff, 72 to 73.1971 PGA Championship: Won by two over Billy Casper.1972 Masters: Won by three over Bruce Crampton, Bobby Mitchell and Tom Weiskopf.1972 U.S. Open: Won by three over Crampton.1973 PGA Championship: Won by four over Crampton.1975 Masters: Beat runners-up Johnny Miller and Weiskopf by one stroke.1975 PGA Championship: Won by two over Crampton.1978 British Open: Won by two strokes over Ben Crenshaw, Raymond Floyd, Tom Kite and Simon Owen.1980 U.S. Open: Won by two over Isao Aoki; lowered his own tournament scoring record to 272 (since broken).1980 PGA Championship: Won by seven, a tournament record (since broken) over Andy Bean.1986 Masters: Nicklaus' final major (and final PGA Tour win) was by one shot over Greg Norman and Tom Kite.Pity poor Bruce Crampton. Crampton won 11 PGA Tour titles, but no majors .... mostly because he was runner-up to Nicklaus four times. Arnold Palmer, Doug Sanders, and Tom Weiskopf were twice each runner-ups to Nicklaus in majors.Speaking of Weiskopf, he gave one of the great quotes about trying to win against Nicklaus in big tournaments down the stretch: ""Jack knew he was going to beat you. You knew Jack was going to beat you. And Jack knew that you knew that he was going to beat you.""02of 06Nicklaus' Majors Win by TournamentTranscendental Graphics/Getty ImagesOrganized another way, here are Nicklaus' major wins listed by tournament:The Masters: 6 wins (1963, 1965, 1966, 1972, 1975, 1986)U.S. Open: 4 wins (1962, 1967, 1972, 1980)British Open: 3 wins (1966, 1970, 1978)PGA Championship: 5 wins (1963, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1980)Nicklaus holds the record for most Masters wins. He shares the record for PGA Championship wins with Walter Hagen; and shares the record for most U.S. Open wins with Willie Anderson, Bobby Jones, and Ben Hogan.While Nicklaus won the British Open fewer times (3) than any of the other majors, in some ways his performance in the Open is most impressive. For example, from 1963 through 1982, Nicklaus finished outside the Top 10 in the British Open only two times. During that stretch of 20 Opens, Nicklaus finished outside the Top 5 only four times and was in the Top 4 15 times.Nicklaus won two majors in the same year five different times: 1963, 1966, 1972, 1975 and 1980. The closest he came to winning three majors in one year was 1972, when Nicklaus won the Masters and U.S. Open, then finished second in the British Open.03of 06Nicklaus' 2nd-Place Finishes in MajorsAl Kooistra/WireImage/Getty ImagesGolfers everywhere know the number that counts most - 18, the number of major wins by Nicklaus.
