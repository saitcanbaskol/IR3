"This is an interactive version of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory.Introduction: Narcissism in personality trait generally conceived of as excessive self love. In Greek mythology Narcissus was a man who fell in love with his reflection in a pool of water. The NPI was developed by Raskin and Hall (1979) for the measurement of narcissism as a personality trait in social psychological research. It is based on the definition of narcissistic personality disorder found in the DSM-III, but is not a diagnostic tool for NPD and instead measures subclinical or normal expressions of narcissism. So, even someone who gets the highest possible score on the NPI does not necessarily have NPD.Procedure: The test consists of forty pairs of statements. For each pair you should select the one that you feel best reflects your personality. It should take most people five to ten minutes to complete.Participation: Your use of this assessment must be strictly for educational purposes. It can not be taken as psychological advice of any kind. If you are interested in anything more than learning about narcissism and how it is assessed, do not take this test. Also, your answers will be anonymously recorded and possibly used for research or otherwise distributed.Source:Raskin, R.; Terry, H. (1988).
