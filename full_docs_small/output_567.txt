"Social Science PsychologyCan forcing a child to change from left to right handed cause stammering, stuttering or any psych.issues?Follow 12 answersAnswersRelevanceRatingNewestOldestBest Answer: I have never heard of stuttering being caused by forcing a child to change from left to right handedness. There are several causes that have been attributed to stuttering. See The Stuttering Foundation web site at www.stutteringhelp.org for loads of information as well as a risk chart to check your child to see if therapy might help. Making a child do things right handed when he/she is really meant to be left handed won't change them other than to cause them to be able to use both hands. They will still revert to the natural left hand unless there is a reason to do it right handed.

As for affecting the psyche that is another matter and very individual. In my case i went to one of those Christian schools, and being left handed was immediately and ignorantly tied to the ""Devil"" In an effort to change my orientation the boogie ladies caned my fingernails with a ruler so that I could not use a pen in my painful hand. Tofay I am ambidextrous, but write a lot better with my left hand than my right ,still. I loath Christian schools for their ignorance and stupid beliefs. So I guess my psyche was introduced to loathing by their actions. In todays society this would be assault and charges could be laid, what a pity that it did not exist in my time at school. Stuttering is related to a nervous condition and lack of confidence and even to a partial deafness being present. Speech therapy and investigation into the ear can often help to overcome this affliction. Stuttering and stammering does not occur when one is singing, isn't that interesting?Shelty K · 1 decade ago1 0 CommentThere is a psych issue in everything you do. Some stammering and stuttering come from having to be forced against ones will maybe through violence.JORGE N · 1 decade ago0 0 CommentIt depends on the technique that is used! Other than that, there is no reason to 'force' a child to change primary use of hands from left to right. Unless, it is to compensate for a serious disability.What, what, what?? · 1 decade ago1 1 CommentMy brother's 5th grade teacher used to hit him on the hand with a ruler because he used his left hand. That was about 45 years ago, but it certainly didn't make him a better person. He was a lefty and he continued to be so till the day he died.nanlwart · 1 decade ago1 0 CommentI have experienced people who have undergone extreme stressful situations which has caused it - although no specific cause has been identified of stuttering/stammering. It must be pointed out though, the majority of stutterers 'grow out of it'.Source (s):www.mcguireprogramme.comJayBee · 1 decade ago0 0 CommentThis is what is called an old wives tale. However evidence has been found that self esteem issues did develop with children who were forced to work with their nondominant hand. This probably had more to do with the abuse that was heaped on them by teachers and the teasing by other classmates.Deirdre O · 1 decade ago0 1 CommentYes. You are telling the child they are not good enough. You are saying that only you know what's best and what is comfortable for the child. You are saying - that the MUST CHANGE - or else! - or else you won't care about them. You are saying that if they don't change, they'll never make it. You are showing your lack - of acceptance, understanding and love. GOD bless.

It's old, out-dated thinking. I'm sure it would be VERY traumatic and disruptive to a child to suffer through this.fdm215 · 1 decade ago0 0 Comment1 2 next"
