"#1 Guest_MarieM._*GuestsPosted 02 August 2000 - 06:41 PMAdvertisementAnyone taking a fiber bulking agent (Metamucil, Citracel, Equalactin, FiberChoice, etc.) - How long do they take to kick in? Do you have to take a few days, weeks, or months before you start to notice some improvement?------------------Advertisement#2Jr & MinnieProlific MemberMembers370 postsPosted 02 August 2000 - 06:56 PMAdvertisementM&M,Traveling 24 feet of intestine could take a few days. Drink at least 8 8ounce glasses of water throughout the day. I take colon care pure psyllium fiber by Yerba Prima 2 heaping teaspoons a day. No perservatives,dyes,sugars other garbage that irratate the colon. Remember to get 25 grams a day of fiber in your diet. -JRQuote of the day and the day after that etc..

I tried the Metamucil Wafers and lst ingredient listed was Absorbic Acid (which is Vit C). Thinking it might be OK - tried it - sure was wrong - started to burn as it came out. So need something that doesn't have any other ingredients besides psyllium. Thanks.------------------#4Jr & MinnieProlific MemberMembers370 postsPosted 02 August 2000 - 08:11 PMAdvertisementM&M, The health food stores. I'd also recommend a consult with a certified nutritionist to get a full handle on I.B.S. Good luck. -GI JR [This message has been edited by JohnR (edited 08-02-2000).]Quote of the day and the day after that etc..

I have access to certain medical information but I am not blinded by this fact and have also had experience with some excellent alternatives to drugs. PM me if I can be of assistance.#6 Guest_MarieM._*GuestsPosted 02 August 2000 - 08:39 PMAdvertisementForgot to mention that I was a D.Have been reading that the bulking agents also help D types.------------------#7 Guest_Tonsil_*GuestsPosted 03 August 2000 - 06:14 AMAdvertisementThe bulking agent that works best for me for D is Equalactin. Takes 1-1/2 to 2 days.L-Glutamine and calcium help me the most. Check out the threads on both elsewhere on the BB.When the D isn't a problem, I take 3/4 tsp PerDiem psyllium with each meal to make sure I get enough bulk. Much cheaper than the Equalactin.------------------Never give up! Never surrender!Back to General Discussion · Next Unread Topic →"
