ATP and NADPHIn a plant cell, where are the ATP synthase complexes located? Thylakoid membrane and inner mitochondrial membraneIn mitochondria, chemiosmosis translocates protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space, whereas in chloroplasts, chemiosmosis translocates protons from the stroma to the thylakoid space.Why are C4 plants able to photosynthesize with no apparent photorespiration?

Why do carotenoids appear yellow and orange? They absorb blue/green light and reflect yellow and red wavelengths of light.Can you tell from these absorption spectra whether red light is effective in driving photosynthesis? One cannot tell from this graph, but because chlorophyll a does absorb red light, we can predict that it would be effective in driving photosynthesis.Which process produces oxygen? Photosynthesis -Oxygen is a by-product of the photosynthesis process.Which set of reactions uses H₂O and produced O₂ The light-dependent reactions.Photosynthesis A series of chemical reactions and electron transfers that covert the energy of light into the chemical energy stored in glucose.Cellular Respiration A common and efficient pathway to produce ATP, which involves a transfer of electrons from a reduced compound to an electron transport chain, and ultimately to an electron acceptor.In photosynthesis plants use carbon dioxide, water, and light energy to produce sugar and other complex molecules. Oxygen is released as a by-product.The complementary process of cellular respiration coverts oxygen and sugar into carbon dioxide and water. In the process some energy is released to make ATP, and the rest is lost as heat.ATP Adenosine triphosphate, a molecule consisting of adenine, a sugar, and three phosphate groups that can be hydrolyxed to release free energy. Universally used by cells to store and transfer energy.Calvin Cycle (occurs in the Stroma) The light-independent component of photosynthesis, in which carbon dioxide is reduced to form sugars. The carbohydrates produced by the Calvin cycle are used in cellular respiration to make ATP for the cell.Two set of reaction of Photosynthesis? 1.) Light dependent reaction: transform the energy in sunlight to chemical energy in the form of electrons with high potential energy. These reactions result in the production of OXYGEN from water. 2.) Light independent reaction: uses ATP and NADPH to reduce carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to sugar, through a set of reactions called CALVIN CYCLE.Light-Dependent Reactions -The light dependent reactions of photosynthesis occur within the thylakoid membranes inside the chloroplast. -Light dependent reaction have two photosystems. In photosystem 1, excited electrons are used to produce NADPH. In photosystem 2 they are used to produce ATP.thylakoid A flattened, membrane-bound disk inside a plant chloroplast. A stack of thylakoids is called a granum.Chloroplast A chlorphyll-containing organelle in plant cells, in which photosynthesis occurs.Chlorophyll A green pigment molecule found in plant cells that absorbs light energy to power photosynthesis.photosystem A complex of molecules and enzymes in plant chloroplasts that takes part in photosynthesis. 1. photosystem 1 (NADPH) 2. photosystem 2 (ATP)Plastoquinone A small, hydrophobic molecule that carries electrons across the thylakoid membrane during photosynthesis.Plastocyanin A small protein that shuttles electrons from photosystem 2 to photosystem 1 during photosynthesis.Pheophytin A molecule, very similar to chlorophyll, that acts as an electron acceptor in photosynthesis.Calvin cycle (3 phases) 1. The fixation phase 2. The reduction phase 3. The regeneration phase -Can occur with or without light and occurs in the stroma.The Fixation Phase (CC) In the fixation phase, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere combines with a 5-carbon molecule called ribulose-bis-phosphate, or RuBP. This process, in which carbon dioxide is made usable to life by incorporating it into an organic molecule called carbon fixation. The product of the initial reaction is an unstable 6-carbon compound that splits to yield two 3 carbon molecules of 3 phosphoglycerate.Carbon Fixation The part of the Calvin Cycle in which carbon atoms are extracted from atmospheric carbon dioxide and used to make simple organic compounds that eventually become glucose.The Reduction Phase (CC) The reduction phase begins when 3 phosphoglycerate is phosphorylated by ATP and concludes when it has been reduced by electrons from NAPDH. The product of the phosphorylated sugar glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate (G3P). Two G3P molecules are used to manufacture glucose.The Regeneration Phase (CC) If the Calvin Cycle did not go through a regeneration phase, the chloroplast would run out of the RuBP molecules required to make glucose.
