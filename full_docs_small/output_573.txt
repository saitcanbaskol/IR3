It may affect dogs of any age or breed, contrary to the myth that it affects only older dogs.Symptoms of Dog TremorsDog tremors while sleeping or awake are not uncommon. One of the major symptoms of dog tremors is panting. Other symptoms of dog tremors include shaking and shivering, weakness, body pain, loss of appetite, inability to cope with day-to-day routine, and loss of vitality and vigor. Dog tremors disrupt the life of the pet as also the owner, and must not be ignored.Causes of Dog TremorsDog tremors may be classified into three categories: head tremors, tremors of pelvic or rear legs, and generalized tremors. Dog tremors causes the body or a part of it to shake, which if unattended, may be fatal. The causes of dog tremors are numerous, including abnormality in brain, infections, hereditary factors, feeble immune system, and digestive disorders, among others.Dog Head and Leg TremorsDog head tremors are the most serious of other forms of tremors, which are usually caused by abnormalities in the cerebellum. The common cause of head tremors in dogs is cerebellar hypoplasia, which may be a genetic condition or caused by infections like that of herpes virus. Dog leg tremors are caused by metabolic disorders like low blood sugar or kidney failure. As such, improper diet and abnormal digestion lead to leg tremors, which, in turn, lead to weakness, fatigue and pain in hind limbs and rear body.Dog Shaking and ShiveringThe last category of dog tremors is that of generalized tremors that affect the entire body and are primarily caused by intake of organophosphate compounds or mycotoxins. Organophosphates are rich in phosphate compounds and are used in fertilizers and pesticides. If you notice your dog shaking and shivering after using these chemicals, you may infer that your pet is poisoned. Mycotoxins are fungal secretions, leading to generalized dog tremors, and as such, dogs must be protected from external agents. As mentioned, dog tremors are either inherited or acquired. If your dog tremors due to genetic constitution, you may control it by controlling excitement and stress and strenuous physical exercise. However, if the condition is acquired, it calls for medical attention. You must visit a vet who would test your dog for the cause of tremors; the tests would include blood test, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and X-rays. Dog tremor is a serious condition and needs care and medical treatment. However, in most cases, it is not fatal and can be cured.Submitted on September 29, 2011SearchCopyright Â© 2017 Mac Millan Interactive Communications, LLCSitemapTerms and Conditions for Usage of this Sitewww.pethealthandcare.com does not provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.
