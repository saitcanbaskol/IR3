"Mar 24, 2009#1curioussoul091. The problem statement, all variables and given/known data Why does water volume increase when heated past 4 degrees Celsius? 2. The attempt at a solution I know that water molecules move quicker when energy is applied (e.g. heat), but I don't understand why the volume of water must increase. Why can't water molecules just move quicker in the same amount of space? I need a molecular explanation.

A simple thought experiment may help to clarify this for you. Consider a group of people standing shoulder-to-shoulder and the floor area they occupy. Now, give them sugar (energy) and have them dance to fast-tempo music (~boiling). Consider the floor area they would then occupy.Mar 26, 2009#3Wellesleycurioussoul09 said: ↑I know that water molecules move quicker when energy is applied (e.g. heat), but I don't understand why the volume of water must increase.

Thanks!Charles's law - related to the gas laws, and the Ideal gas law (PV=nRT), explains that \frac {V_ {1}} {T_ {1}} = constant} or V 1 = T 1 Why gases expand: When temperature goes up, so does volume. Why all states of matter expand with energy: When energy is added, the particles move faster and bounce off the container harder. The average kinetic energy of each molecule increases as the temperature goes up. As a result, the particles move away from each other, causing the volume to increase. EDIT: Somehow I missed that the question was about liquid water. Sorry..... Charles's law is not related to liquids...thanks Borek.Last edited: Mar 26, 2009Mar 26, 2009#4BorekStaff: MentorWellesley said: ↑Charles's law - related to the gas lawsHow is it related to the volume of liquid?"
