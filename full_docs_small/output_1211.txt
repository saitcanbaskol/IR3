Of course, because of perspective reasons, things that are nearer are painted more vivid, while those ones which are distant should be pale. But having lived near the beach for some years ago, I kept in my mind that in what far the sea is concerned, this rule can't be applied. If I remember well, the sea seems to be a deeper blue near the horizon line and then it changes to green, lighter and almost white near the sand. Is it right? How do you paint the sea? According to the general rule or, on the contrary, deeper blue and more vivid near the horizon line? Thanks to you all. Maria EsterMarty C 08-27-2005, 11:42 PMHi Maria, It depends a bit on atmospherics such as cloud and time of day. On an overcast day the sea can almost merge with the sky, making it hard to pick the difference. The transitions of colour can also depend on the elevation of the viewer. At sea level the transitions can be spread out ie. you have a longer foreground, so see more of the lighter colour. As the viewer gains elevation the transitions reduce, so you see less light colour and more darker water. So from a cliff you would see more of the deeper, darker water. Generally, with distance over the sea on a bright day the vividness (and by this I think you mean the intenstiy or saturation of the colour) does not actually increase. What changes is usually the value of the colour decreases, ie it gets darker towards the horizon, but it does not get more intense. In high humidity conditions the visual distance to the horizon can be decreased, and the sea colour/value may not change much at all , or in fact lighten with distance to an indistinct horizon line. Really, the light, the weather, the atmospheric conditions will all influence what is happening, so good observation is the best way to determine your sea colours.artesplasticas 08-28-2005, 10:28 PMGreat, Marty. I'll try to pay attention to these details from now on. You're very patient and kind to give such a good and detailed explanation. Maria Esterartmead 09-07-2005, 01:44 PMGreat explanation Marty... I think wind is a big factor as well. When the ocean surface is not effected by wind, is calm and glassy, the sky is reflected off of more of the oceans surface area, therefore picking up more of the sky's color. Opposite, when its real windy and chopy you tend to see more of the deeper ocean colors IMO... Just a thoughtartesplasticas 09-11-2005, 01:43 PMHi, artmead, thank you for the reply. I think you're both right. With your comments I can surely improve my work. Maria EsterFabulous 09-23-2005, 05:43 AMMartin, this was a very interesting explanation. Thanks Fabbsnowden 09-23-2005, 06:37 PMLearned a lot from this Marty. Thanks.vBulletin® v3.5.8, Copyright ©2000-2018, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd."
