Does anyone know exaclty how to decipher between when some vegetable is a starch and when its not? or where i can look this up? ThankyouJDJD2004 Sun, Apr-02-06, 11:29It depends on the type of squash. None are techinically ""starches,"" but some have higher sugar content than others and may have an impact on blood sugar. Acorn squash is higher in sugar than summer or yellow squash and spaghetti squash. Generally, if it tastes sweeter (I use the color as a rule of thumb. Orange = higher sugar), than you should use in moderation in OWL or avoid during induction. I believe DANDR lists the accpetable induction squashes, but I don't have my copy handy.nikkil Sun, Apr-02-06, 12:15Go to www.fitday.com (it's free) and check out the different carb counts for squashes. Zucchini is super-low and I use that all the time, even on Induction. Spaghetti squash is great to use in place of pasta, topped with meatballs and tomato sauce and lots of fresh parmesan :yum: Depends on where you are in daily carb allowance on whether squash (and how much of it and what kind) fits into your meal plan or not. Oh, another thing - mashed turnip with lots of butter and pepper (can add some parmesan or other cheese, too) is a great substitute for potatoes. Can be shredded for fried potatoes, turnip fries, etc.nikkil Sun, Apr-02-06, 12:33Spaghetti Squash: Amount Per 1 cup, cooked Calories 41.85 Total Fat 0.403g Total Carbohydrate 10.01g Dietary Fiber 2.17g Protein 1.02g  (7.84g ECC per cup, cooked) _____________________________________ Acorn Squash Amount Per 1 cup, mashed Calories 83.3 Total Fat 0.196g Total Carbohydrate 21.51g Dietary Fiber 6.37g Protein 1.64g  (15.14g ECC per cup, cooked and mashed) ________________________________________ Butternut Squash Amount Per 1 cup, mashed Calories 93.6 Total Fat 0.168g Total Carbohydrate 24.12g Dietary Fiber 0g Protein 2.95g  (24.12g ECC per cup, cooked and mashed)Malishka31 Sun, Apr-02-06, 13:55i did use fit day, and i know the carb content, but i mean what techinically constitutes the classification of ""starch"" does higher carb mean starch?ProfGumby Sun, Apr-02-06, 14:08i did use fit day, and i know the carb content, but i mean what techinically constitutes the classification of ""starch"" does higher carb mean starch? Not always....especially with squash. As was said, no squash is technically listed as a starch. Higer carb will definately mean higher occuring sugars though....arc Mon, Apr-03-06, 08:13Butternut Squash Amount Per 1 cup, mashed Calories 93.6 Total Fat 0.168g Total Carbohydrate 24.12g Dietary Fiber 0g Protein 2.95g  (24.12g ECC per cup, cooked and mashed) There's a glitch in your program. There are 5.7G of fiber in a cup of butternut squash. http://www.wholehealthmd.com/refshelf/foods_view/1,1523,189,00.htmlnikkil Mon, Apr-03-06, 08:14Weird - I got that from Fitday..... I'll go and check My PLAN and see what it says. Thanks for the heads up :)Malishka31 Mon, Apr-03-06, 16:50stupid question, but what officially makes a potatoe a starch? how do you like actually know that x object is a starch and y is not? lets say its not squash, its just anything  (sorry ia m not trying to be annoying i just want to know)Judynyc Mon, Apr-03-06, 17:08stupid question, but what officially makes a potatoe a starch? how do you like actually know that x object is a starch and y is not? lets say its not squash, its just anything  (sorry ia m not trying to be annoying i just want to know) It maybe the glycemic load/index that makes it a starch. White potato digests faster (turns to sugar) than sweet potato....so the glycemic index of white potato is higher than it is for sweet potato. When using the glycemic index, you want low numbers, under 50, for it to be considered low. Hope this helps! :DMyJourney Mon, Apr-03-06, 18:53Starch is a complex carbohydrate which is insoluble in water. Its presence in foods and other substances can be detected by the blue-black color produced when iodine solution is added to a sample of the material to be tested. By treatment with hot water, starch granules have been shown to consist of at least two components, known as amylopectin and amylose. Amylopectin is a branched glucose polymer; amylose is a linear glucose polymer.Malishka31 Tue, Apr-04-06, 14:08Starch is a complex carbohydrate which is insoluble in water.
