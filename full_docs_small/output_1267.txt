The population of the town was 5,305 in 2010. The town was established and built as the base village to Vail Ski Resort, with which it was originally conceived. Vail Ski Resort's first season was in December 1962; it is the largest ski mountain in Colorado.Contents [ hide ]1 History2 Geography2.1 Vail Mountain3 Climate4 Transportation4.1 Highways5 Demographics6 Economy7 Arts and culture7.1 Notable cultural events7.2 Museums and other points of interest8 Government9 Education10 Media11 Pop Culture12 Notable people13 See also14 References15 External linksHistory  [ edit]The ""Ski Trooper"" bronze sculpture by Scott Stearman in Slifer Plaza honors soldiers of the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division, which trained in the area during World War II.Vail was incorporated in 1966, four years after the opening of Vail Ski Resort. The ski area was founded by Pete Seibert and local rancher Earl Eaton in 1962, at the base of Vail Pass. The pass was named after Charles Vail, the highway engineer who routed U.S. Highway 6 through the Eagle Valley in 1940, which eventually became Interstate 70. Seibert, a New England native, served in the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division during World War II, which trained at Camp Hale, 14 miles south of Vail between Red Cliff and Leadville. He was wounded in Italy at the Battle of Riva Ridge but went on to become a professional skier after he recovered.  [8]Seibert, with other former members of the 10th Mountain Division, returned to Colorado after World War II with the intention of opening a ski resort. During training for ski troopers at Camp Hale, he bivouacked on Vail Mountain and identified it as an ideal ski mountain. In the early 1960s, Seibert got funds from a group of Colorado investors, including Jack Tweedy, and with Earl Eaton bought a ranch at the base of the mountain and eventually incorporated as Vail Associates. As plans continued for a new ski resort, Seibert hired Morrie Shepard as Vail's first ski school director. Shortly after, Shepard recruited Rod Slifer from Aspen to be assistant ski school director. Slifer also became the only real estate broker in the early years of Vail and would later be the broker in the transaction that allowed Vail to buy a ranch, now known as the world-famous Beaver Creek.In December 1962 Vail officially opened for its first season. It operated a gondola lift and two ski lifts on the mountain owned by the United States Forest Service. The village was established at the base of the mountain for local residents and offered lodging for visitors. It quickly grew throughout the valley with housing added first in East Vail and then West Vail, and additional lodging added in Lionshead in the late 1960s.  [8]  [9] Within the first years the village had a ski shop operated by John Houserman, a hotel and restaurant operated by Pepi Gramshammer, and the mountain had a manager.  [10] By 1969 Vail was the most popular ski resort in the state. In 1988 Vail opened China Bowl, making Vail the largest ski area in North America.Geography  [ edit]Vail's average elevation is 8,150 feet (2484 m) above sea level. The town has a total area of 4.5 square miles (12 km 2 ), with no lakes (there is, however, at least one pond). Gore Creek flows from east to west through the center of town.The town is surrounded by the White River National Forest and the Vail Ski Resort is leased from the United States Forest Service. Mount of the Holy Cross is visible from Vail Mountain.Vail Mountain  [ edit]See also: Vail Ski ResortVail Mountain rises from 8,120 feet (2,476 m) to 11,570 feet (3,527 m), giving a vertical rise of 3,450 feet (1,052 m).  [11] It has a 5,289 acres (2,140 ha) skiable area, 33 ski lifts, 193 marked skiing trails on three faces: the front side, the back bowls, and Blue Sky Basin. The seven back bowls are Sun Down Bowl, Sun Up Bowl, Teacup Bowl, China Bowl, Siberia Bowl, Inner Mongolia Bowl, and Outer Mongolia Bowl. Blue Sky Basin includes Pete's Bowl and Earl's Bowl—to commemorate Pete Seibert and Earl Eaton.Climate  [ edit] [ hide] Climate data for Vail, ColoradoMonth Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec YearRecord high °F (°C) 51  (11) 55  (13) 66  (19) 74  (23) 82  (28) 91  (33) 95  (35) 92  (33) 86  (30) 79  (26) 66  (19) 51  (11) 95  (35)Average high °F (°C) 29.1  (−1.6) 33.0  (0.6) 42.3  (5.7) 49.9  (9.9) 60.8  (16) 72.2  (22.3) 77.7  (25.4) 75.3  (24.1) 67.1  (19.5) 54.1  (12.3) 37.6  (3.1) 28.2  (−2.1) 52.3  (11.3)Average low °F (°C) 5.7  (−14.6) 8.5  (−13.1) 16.5  (−8.6) 23.7  (−4.6) 30.8  (−0.7) 35.2  (1.8) 41.2  (5.1) 40.4  (4.7) 33.0  (0.6) 24.8  (−4) 14.6  (−9.7) 6.4  (−14.2) 23.4  (−4.8)Record low °F (°C) −21  (−29) −32  (−36) −16  (−27) −1  (−18) 13  (−11) 19  (−7) 28  (−2) 22  (−6) 14  (−10) 1  (−17) −16  (−27) −22  (−30) −32  (−36)Average precipitation inches (mm) 1.87  (47.5) 2.08  (52.8) 1.80  (45.7) 2.22  (56.4) 1.83  (46.5) 1.49  (37.8) 1.95  (49.5) 1.86  (47.2) 2.07  (52.6) 1.72  (43.7) 1.91  (48.5) 1.61  (40.9) 22.41  (569.1)Average snowfall inches (cm) 33.8  (85.9) 33.2  (84.3) 24.4  (62) 22.2  (56.4) 4.8  (12.2) 0.3  (0.8) 0  (0) 0  (0) 1.1  (2.8) 7.7  (19.6) 27.6  (70.1) 28.3  (71.9) 183.4  (466)Average precipitation days  (≥ 0.01 inch)12 12 9 10 9 8 10 12 10 7 10 10 119Source: Western Regional Climate Center  [12]Vail has warm summers and cold winters because of its elevation. Depending on the classification used, it is either an alpine or subarctic climate transitional with humid continental due to the mild daytime temperatures in September bringing the daily mean to around 50 °F (10 °C). Minimum temperatures rarely rise above freezing point from late September to late May. The town receives an average of 200 inches of snowfall per season, with even more in the surrounding mountains. Roads may close occasionally during heavy snowfall. Summer temperatures can reach the 80s, but are more often in the mid to high 70s. Combined with mountain breezes, this makes summers refreshing and cool. For being a borderline subarctic climate daytime temperatures are very mild, indicating high diurnal temperature variation due to the altitude.Transportation  [ edit]North side of Vail Mountain, and Vail Valley.Vail is served by Eagle County Airport near Gypsum, 30 miles to the west. Native Americans used to call the area near the airport the ""hole in the sky"" because storms seemed to avoid it. Vail is modeled on European ski towns, many of which are car-free, and the town is partially pedestrianized. The town operates the largest free shuttle bus system in the United States and has ten hybrid-electric buses. At each bus stop, a sign reports when the next two buses will arrive.The in-Town Shuttle provides service every five minutes during peak winter times, and every 15 minutes off-peak, between Golden Peak, Vail Village, the business district, and Lionshead, with live schedule information provided at bus stops by Global Positioning System technology, which tracks buses. Other routes centering on the Transportation Center service the East and West Vail districts on a scheduled, but less frequent basis.  [13]Eagle County provides bus service from the Transportation Center with service to Vail, Leadville, Miniturn, Eagle-Vail, Avon, Beaver Creek, Edwards, Eagle, Gypsum and Dotsero.Highways  [ edit]Interstate 70 runs east–west through the middle of Vail and is the only road to or from Vail, with exits at East Vail, at the base of Vail Pass, the town of Vail, and West Vail. From the east, the highway comes from Denver, 97 miles away, passes through Eisenhower Tunnel and over the Continental Divide, by-passing Loveland Pass, and over Vail Pass, dropping down into Vail Valley. To the west, it meets U.S. Highway 24 at Dowd Junction, passes through Avon, Edwards, Colorado, and Eagle, through Glenwood Canyon traveling and on to Grand Junction, and reaches Utah, where it ends at the intersection with Interstate 15.In West Vail, U.S. Highway 6  (which still exists as a service road between East Vail, Vail, and West Vail) merges with I-70 at Dowd Junction. I-70 roughly follows the original Highway 6 route until the two highways diverge again in Silverthorne, 31 miles to the east.Demographics  [ edit]Historical populationCensus Pop. %±1970 484 —1980 2,261 367.1%1990 3,659 61.8%2000 4,531 23.8%2010 5,305 17.1%Est. 2016 5,483  [7] 3.4%U.S. Decennial Census  [14]The 2000 census  [15] found 4,531 people, 2,165 households, and 762 families living in the town.
