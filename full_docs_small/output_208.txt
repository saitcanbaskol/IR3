"Disease ClusterAlso found in: Dictionary, Thesaurus, Legal, Encyclopedia, Wikipedia . (1) Two or more cases of a relatively uncommon event or disease related in time and/or placeperceived to be greater than expected by chance (2) An unusual aggregation, real or perceived, of health events that are grouped together in time andspace, which is reported to a public health departmentSegen's Medical Dictionary. © 2012 Farlex, Inc. All rights reserved.diseasetraditionally defined as a finite abnormality of structure or function with an identifiablepathological or clinicopathological basis, and with a recognizable syndrome or constellation of clinical signs.This definition has long since been widened to embrace subclinical diseases in which there is no tangible clinical syndrome but which are identifiable by chemical, hematological,biophysical, microbiological or immunological means. The definition is used even more widely to include failure to produce at expected levels in the presence of normal levels of nutritionalsupply and environmental quality. It is to be expected that the detection of residues of disqualifying chemicals in foods of animal origin will also come to be included within thescope of disease.For specific diseases see under the specific name, e.g. Aujeszsky's disease, Bang'sdisease, foot-and-mouth disease.air-borne diseasethe causative agent is transmitted via the air without the need for intervention by othermedium. See also wind-borne disease.disease carriersee carrier, vector.clinical diseasesee clinical  (3).disease clustera group of animals with the same disease occurs at an unusual level of prevalence for thepopulation as a whole. The cluster may be in space, with high concentrations in particularlocalities, or in time, with high concentrations in particular seasons or in particular years.communicable diseaseinfectious disease in which the causative agents may pass or be carried from one animal to another directly or indirectly on inanimate objects or via vectors.complicating diseaseone that occurs in the course of some other disease as a complication.constitutional diseaseone involving a system of organs or one with widespread signs.contagious diseasesee communicable disease  (above).disease controlreducing the prevalence of a disease in a population, including eradication, by chemical,pharmaceutical, quarantine, management including culling, or other means or combinations of means.disease control programsorganized routines specifying agents, administration, time and personnel allocations,community support, funding, participation of corporate or government agencies, animal andanimal product disposal.deficiency diseasea condition due to dietary or metabolic deficiency, including all diseases caused by an insufficient supply of essential nutrients.degenerative joint diseasesee degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis.demyelinating diseaseany condition characterized by destruction of myelin.disease determinantany variable associated with a disease which, if removed or altered, results in a change in the incidence of the disease.egg-borne diseasean infectious disease of birds in which the agent is spread via the egg.endemic diseasesee endemic.environmental disease controlcontrol by changing the environment, e.g. draining a swamp, ventilating a barn.epidemic diseasesee epidemic.etiological disease classificationdiseases arranged in the order of their etiological agents, e.g. bacterial, mycoplasma.exotic diseasea disease that does not occur in the subject country. Said of infectious diseases that may be introduced, e.g. rabies is exotic to the UK, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia is exotic to the USA.focal diseasea localized disease.fulminant diseasean explosive outbreak in a group or a rapidly developing, peracute development of a disease in an individual. Called also fulminating.functional diseaseany disease involving body functions but not associated with detectable organic lesion or change.generalized diseaseone involving all or many body systems; often said of infectious diseases in which there is spread via the bloodstream. See also systemic disease  (below).glycogen diseaseany of a group of genetically determined disorders of glycogen metabolism, marked by abnormal storage of glycogen in the body tissues. See also glycogen storage disease.heavy chain diseasesee heavy-chain disease.hemolytic disease of newbornsee alloimmune hemolytic anemia of the newborn.hemorrhagic disease of newbornsee neonatal hemorrhagic disease.disease historythat part of a patient's history which relates only to the disease from which the patient is suffering.holoendemic diseasemost animals in the population are affected.hyperendemic diseasethe rate of infection is steady but high.hypoendemic diseasethe rate of infection is steady and only a few animals are infected.immune complex diseasesee immune complex disease.infectious diseaseone caused by small living organisms including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa andmetazoan parasites. It may be contagious in origin, result from nosocomial infections or be due to endogenous microflora of the nose and throat, skin or bowel. See alsocommunicable disease  (above).manifestational disease classificationdiseases arranged in the order of their clinical signs, epidemiological characteristics,necropsy lesions, e.g. sudden death diseases.mesoendemic diseasethe disease occurs at an even rate and a moderate proportion of animals are infected.metabolic diseasesee metabolic diseases.molecular diseaseany disease in which the pathogenesis can be traced to a single, precise chemicalalteration, usually of a protein, which is either abnormal in structure or present in reducedamounts. The corresponding defect in the DNA coding for the protein may also be known.multicausal disease1. a number of causative agents are needed to combine to cause the disease.2. the same disease can be caused by a number of different agents.multifactorial diseasesee multicausal disease  (above).new diseasedisease not previously recorded. May be variants on an existing disease, e.g. infectiousbovine rhinotracheitis, or escapes from other species, e.g. the Marburg virus disease of humans.notifiable diseasea disease of which any occurrence is required by law to be notified to governmentauthorities.organic diseasesee organic disease.pandemic diseasea very widespread epidemic involving several countries or an entire continent.quarantinable diseasea disease which the law requires to be restricted in its spread by putting the affectedanimals, farms or properties on which it occurs in quarantine.reportable diseasesee notifiable disease  (above).disease reservoirany animal or fomite in which an infectious disease agent is preserved in a viable state or multiplies and upon which it may depend for survival.secondary disease1. a disease subsequent to or a consequence of another disease or condition.2. a condition due to introduction of incompatible, immunologically competent cells into a host rendered incapable of rejecting them by heavy exposure to ionizing radiation.self-limited diseasesee self-limited.sex-limited diseasedisease limited in its occurrence to one or other sex. See also sex-linked.sexually transmitted disease  (STD)a disease that can be acquired by sexual intercourse.slaughter disease controlsee slaughter  (2).sporadic diseaseoccurring singly and haphazardly; widely scattered; not epidemic or endemic. See alsosporadic bovine encephalomyelitis, sporadic leukosis, sporadic lymphangitis.storage diseasesee storage disease.disease syndromesee syndrome.systemic diseasesufficiently widespread in the body to cause clinical signs referable to any organ or system, and in which localization of infection may occur in any organ.disease triangleinteraction between the host, the disease agent, and the environment.disease wastageloss of income generated by production of milk, eggs, fiber, or loss of capital valuebecause of diminution in the patient's value.wasting diseaseany disease marked especially by progressive emaciation and weakness.zoonotic diseasedisease capable of spread from animals to humans.
