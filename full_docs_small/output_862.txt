"Does a scan harm your baby?by MICHAEL HANLON, Daily MailLast weekend, mothers-to-be were given the alarming news that ultra-sound scans might be damaging their unborn children. For years some scientists have suspected that ultrasound scans could be causing subtle but profound damage to the baby in the womb.In particular, a puzzling link between the scans and an increase in the incidence of left-handedness was noticed.Now a group of Swedish scientists claim to have found evidence that ultra-sound could damage the unborn child. If the results are confirmed, there will have to be a total rethink of the way pregnancies are handled by the medical profession.But not everyone is convinced by these findings. One leading obstetrician called the study 'flawed' and said that it risked scaring women unnecessarily.Below is a complete guide to what we know about ultrasound. How it works, and what are the potential risks - and, most importantly, whether these risks outweigh the benefits.What is ultrasound?Ultrasound scanners work rather like a ship's sonar, generating high-frequency sound waves to produce a detailed image of the foetus and the inside of the womb.They are routinely used in nearly all pregnancies to check for abnormalities in the developing foetus - and have saved thousands of babies' lives since they were introduced in the Sixties.Nearly all women in the West have access to ultrasound scans and in Britain this is routinely done at 12 weeks and again at 20.What abnormalities do ultrasound scanners pick up?Ultrasound will pick up around 70 per cent of serious abnormalities of the foetus - about one in 50 unborn babies have severe problems. These include hydrocephalus, spina bifida, short limbs, dwarfism and heart abnormalities. Some of these conditions can be treated inside the womb - such as kidney and bladder problems. Ultrasound scans can also detect the sex of the unborn child.According to Professor Stuart Campbell, a British pioneer of the ultrasound technique: 'A routine scan is a way of allowing women the choice of terminating severe abnormalities, and it is a way of telling doctors how to treat babies before or after birth, saving their lives.'What did Swedish scientists find?The team compared men whose mothers underwent scanning in the Seventies, with those whose mothers did not. They were looking for differences in the rates of left and right handedness. They found that the men whose mothers underwent scanning were more likely to be left-handed.Why did they just study men?In Sweden a man's left- or right-handedness is routinely assessed as part of the physical examination prior to military national service byhanding them a gun and seeing which shoulder they sling it on.There is no accurate, comprehensive data for left-handedness rates in women, as they are exempt from conscription. There is no suggestion this effect is not present in women; but it was not measured.What is the normal rate of left-handedness? And what difference did scanning make?'Normal' left-handedness, which is determined by genetic makeup, occurs in about 8-9 per cent of the population.In addition, it is known that a small number of people who are 'genetically' right-handed may become left-handed or ambidextrous after suffering lesions (tears) to the left side of the brain before they are six years old.Professor Helle Kieler and his colleagues found that scanning increased the 'risk' of being left-handed by about 30 per cent - which corresponds to an extra three left-handers in 100.This could possibly explain a puzzling increase in left-handedness seen in the West in the past 30 years, an increase which can only partly be explained by a change in the once-negative attitude towards left-handed children by teachers.Why is this a problem?There is no harm in being left-handed as such. But because it is known that people can 'switch' handedness after birth because of naturally-occurring lesions in the left-hand side of the brain (see previous point), the suspicion is that the ultrasound scanning in some way causes similar lesions in the brains of the unborn.The brain continues to develop right throughout pregnancy, and the left-hand side is more prone to damage as it develops more slowly than the right. It would be impossible for ultrasound scans to affect the genetics of the foetus - this is set at conception - therefore the conclusion is that scanning is causing some sort of brain damage.As Professor Kenneth Rothman, of the Boston University Medical Center, says: 'It raises the worrisome possibility that ultrasound exposure is also affecting the central nervous system in other less evident ways. An effect on the brain of three offspring in every 100 would have a huge population effect, a potentially-important public-health problem that could not be dismissed out of hand.'Share or comment on this articleUS college football player, 21, found dead in Mexico City...
