"Research at the Center for Sickle Cell DiseaseWhat Kind of Research is Done at the Center?The Center has a long history of major participation and leadership in national and international research projects that have led to the development of effective therapies for sickle cell disease. With many of the basic molecular issues in sickle cell disease being better understood, major research efforts now focus primarily on clinical issues such as treatment for the disease. Much of the Centerâ€™s research is also devoted to the prevention and treatment of excess body iron, high blood pressure in the lungs, and to the study of a natural chemical called nitric oxide. Low nitric oxide levels impair the flow of blood so nitric oxide administration is being investigated for possible therapeutic applications in sickle cell disease. The role that vitamin deficiencies play in the manifestations of sickle cell disease is also being investigated.Publications and AbstractsYear 2011Year 2010Years 2000 - 2009Center-Affiliated Events  (Archive)Current Federal GrantsPulmonary Hypertension and the Hypoxic Response in Sickle Cell Disease (NIH Application # 1 R01 HL079912) A multi-centered research endeavor to determine the prevalence and risk factors of pulmonary hypertension in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease, and the role of hypoxic responses in pulmonary hypertension pathogenesis.Howard-Children's National Medical Center Sickle Cell Disease Clinical Center (NIH Application # 1 U10 HL083748) Collaboration among the sickle cell programs of  three institutions in the Washington, DC area, namely, Howard University, the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health and Children's National Medical Center (CNMC).Howard University Research Scientist Award (NIH Application # 5 UH1 HL003679) The long-term goal of this grant is to establish a strong molecular genetics research program at Howard University. The program envisioned will greatly enhance research at the Howard University College of Medicine in the area of genetic hemoglobin disorders.Regulation of HIV-1 Transcription by CDK2 (NIH Application # SCORE 1 SC1 GM082325) The over-arching goal of this research venture is to identify mechanisms to overcome HIV-1 drug-resistance as related to viral replication within host cells. The proposed research is designed to determine whether CDK2 phosphorylates HIV-1 Tat during HIV-1 transcription and whether this phosphorylation is physiologically important for viral replication.Basic and Translational Research Program (BTRP) in Sickle Cell Disease (NIH Application # 1 U54 HL090508) The Basic and Translational Research Program (BTRP) in Sickle Cell Disease provides funding for a collaboration with Children's National Medical Center to conduct a study dealing with neurodevelopmental deficits among infants and toddlers with sickle cell disease. Also included in this program is a scholar component dedicated to training physicians in sickle cell disease clinical research and patient management.Current Industry and Federal Contracts  (Archive)Improving Pain Management and Outcomes with Various Strategies of Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) (IMPROVE). Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) means that the patient is in control of his/her pain medicine. In this study two (2) different treatment plans of Patient-Controlled Analgesia will be used to treat people with sickle cell disease who are admitted to the hospital for a pain crisis. The purpose of this study is to find out if one plan is better than the other in controlling sickle cell pain.Preventing Acute Chest Syndrome by Transfusion (PROACTIVE) Feasibility Study. The purpose of this study, which is sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the federal government, is to learn whether blood transfusions may prevent ACS when sickle cell patients hospitalized for pain develop an elevated sPLA2 (a blood enzyme). However, in order to learn whether the sPLA2 will be a good test for predicting ACS, and whether enough patients will be available for the full study, the investigators are conducting this Screening (Feasibility) Study.Phase II/III Trial of Sildenafil for Sickle Cell Disease Associated Pulmonary Hypertension (NIH Contract # HHSN268200617189C) Howard University will act as one of a number of clinical sites for a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to test the effects of 16 weeks of chronic sildenafil therapy on exercise endurance.
