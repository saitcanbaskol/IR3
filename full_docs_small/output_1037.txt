"Grounded, 5 A.M. The nitelite is comforting, But gravity is holding you.Once settled into sleep You have watched, on repeat, The story of your life Across the ceiling; And in review,You've said the air was singing It's calling you, you don't believe These things you've never seen""Good morning, and how are you? The weather's fine, the sky is blue - It's perfect for our seminar...""Related23 Boy Band Slow Jams That Made You Believe In Love Every Lyric From Cardi B's Debut Album 'Invasion of Privacy' Every Lyric From The Weeknd's New EP 'My Dear Melancholy,'""Now close your eyes, And start to breathe. Allow the noise to recede... ...Allow yourself to drift and fly away."" But you just stay.You've said the air was singing It's calling you, you don't believe These things you've never seen, never dreamed.Did you hear these voices callingLocked into the conference room, ""We're only what our minds assume..."" And rationale is leaving you.This conceit, these systems of belief, Your counselor agrees, ""You've always marked these boundaries, now you're free..."" And with relief.PhotosYou've said the air was singing It's calling you, you don't believe These things you've never seen, never heard, never dreamed.You've said the air was singing It's calling you, you don't believe These things you've never seenNever, never, never.Once you had a dream Of oceans, and sunken cities; Memories of things you've never known And you have never known.Song Discussions is protected by U.S. Patent 9401941.
