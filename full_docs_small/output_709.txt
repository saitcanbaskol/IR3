This procedure can be performed for various reasons, including a block in the intestine due to scar tissue, colon cancer, diverticular disease, familial polyposis or ulcerative colitis. The colon helps your body in the absorption of minerals and water. People recovering from a colon resection require specific diets, including small, frequent meals and temporary low-fiber intake.Small, Frequent MealsBecause the colon is in recovery mode after a resection, avoid big meals at once. Instead, eat five to eight small meals per day, spacing them out at consistent intervals. Smaller meals will reduce the stress on your resected colon, can better manage your symptoms and will lead to improved digestion and absorption. In addition to consuming smaller, more frequent meals, make sure to chew well while eating your food slowly. As your colon continues to heal, reintroduce new foods and work your way back up to three meals per day.A Closer Look: Protein and DairyKeep in mind that consuming protein after a colon resection is essential to the healing process. Examples of foods high in protein include fish, chicken, turkey, beef, pork, eggs, tofu, dairy products and smooth nut butters, like creamy peanut butter. After a colon resection, the gut tends to produce a lower volume of the enzymes needed for milk digestion. For this reason, cut down dairy intake to 2 cups of low-fat or fat-free diary products per day after surgery. Other options include lactose-free products.The Fiber FactorYour body may have a difficult time digesting fiber after your surgery. This is especially true when it comes to insoluble fiber, which is found in whole grain and bran foods. Stick to low-fiber foods, or foods that contain more soluble fiber, since soluble fiber is often tolerated better and slows down digestion. Examples of soluble fiber foods include oatmeal, oat bran, barley, soy, beans, nut butters and fruit. Good low-fiber options include white bread, cereals such as corn flakes, potatoes without skin, white rice and pasta,Special ConsiderationsYou may find that certain foods cause gas, loose stools or constipation. When you notice a food causes any of these issues, avoid it. Call a doctor if you begin experiencing diarrhea or become sick to your stomach. If you have constipation, get up and walk around more frequently, or consider stool softens -- like milk of magnesia or magnesium citrate -- if your doctor allows. Avoid laxatives without your doctor's approval.References  (4)MedlinePlus: Large Bowel Resection - DischargeMedlinePlus: Large Bowel ResectionMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center: Nutrition Guidelines for Patients With Short Bowel SyndromeDana-Farber Cancer Institute: Eating After Colon SurgeryAbout the AuthorJessica Jones is a registered dietitian with a master's degree in nutrition.
