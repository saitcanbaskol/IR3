Over the course of his lifetime, the Alabama native has received over 50 honorary degrees from prestigious universities, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011 by President Barack Obama.In an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” that will air on Sunday, Lewis says that he does not think Trump is a “legitimate president.” In an excerpt released Friday, Lewis tells host Chuck Todd, “I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. I don’t plan to attend the inauguration. It will be the first one that I miss since I’ve been in the Congress. You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right.” In retaliation, the president-elect took to Twitter with a post that read, “Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results.”Read on to learn more about Representative John Lewis.1.

As the group made their way out of Selma, they were met by about 150 Alabama State troopers who violently advanced on the activists with clubs, bullwhips, and tear gas, according to the American Originals from the National Archives.25-year-old Lewis was beat by “a state trooper with a nightstick”, and suffered a skull fracture. He was just one of 58 who were treated at a local hospital for injuries. Speaking with Democracy Now last year, Lewis said, “I had a concussion at the bridge. My legs went out from under me. I felt like I was going to die. I thought I saw Death.

Lewis said that the Troopers used tear gas to stop the demonstrators despite the fact that none of the marchers used violence or any kind of retaliation. “Well, when we were forced back, most of the people in line knelt in a prayerful manner; they had back toward the — Selma, kneeling, the line all the way back was almost a spontaneous reaction on the part of all the people in the line as far back as you could see, and at that time the Major ordered the Trooper to put on their gas masks, and they started throwing gas, and people became sick and started vomiting, and some of us was forced off of the highway and behind some buildings in the woods.”Read More From HeavyLyle and Erik Menendez: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know3.

He Co-Authored a ‘New York Times’ Bestselling Graphic NovelCongressman John Lewis signs copies of his book at the Emancipation Of Capital Gala And Awards Ceremony celebrating the 150th Anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation at Washington Convention Center on August 22, 2013 in Washington, DC.

The New York Times writes, “… it’s a capsule lesson in courage of conscience, a story that inspires without moralizing or simplifying in hindsight.”The third book in the March trilogy, “March: Book Three”, was published in August 2016, and won the National Book Award for Young People’s literature. Speaking with Graphic Novel Reporter, Lewis was asked why he decided to share his stories as a series of graphic memoir. He said:It was an attempt to make the words come alive. When I first moved to Atlanta back in 1963, at the age of 23, I was here to see Martin Luther King, Jr. preach. And his father would be in the church and would urge his son: ‘Make it plain, make it real.’ I think by using the graphic format, it is making it available to a lot of people who want to read and see those illustrations, and to make them feel it. Especially young children. It’s not just simple words; it’s actions. And that’s what my life has been and what the movement was. It was about action.Lewis told NBC News that he doesn’t plan on attending Trump’s inauguration. “It will be the first one that I miss since I’ve been in Congress. You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right.”Read More From HeavyMeryl Streep, The Cecil B.
