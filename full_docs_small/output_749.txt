"Science & Mathematics ChemistryWhat is the formula for air ? ( Chemical Equation )? ( like Co2,H2O2 )Follow 10 answersAnswersRelevanceRatingNewestOldestBest Answer: Because air is a mixture of gases and not an element or a compound by itself, you cannot write a per-se formula for it. However, you can write out a formula for each of the things that air is comprised of. Below, please find the sea-level composition of air (in percent by volume at the temperature of 15°C and the pressure of 101325 Pa) First is the name of the component, then the chemical formula, then the percent concentration. Nitrogen N2 78.084 % Oxygen O2 20.9476 % Argon Ar 0.934 % Carbon Dioxide CO2 0.0314 % Neon Ne 0.001818 % Methane CH4 0.0002 % Helium He 0.000524 % Krypton Kr 0.000114 % Hydrogen H2 0.00005 % Xenon Xe 0.0000087 % Also, please note that the air we breathe also contains water vapor (H20), the concentration of which depends on the current humidity level, along with pollutants and other small particles (e.g. ""smog"").Source (s):CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics by David R.

Air is a mixture of several gases. It contains about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases.rubidium.chloride · 1 decade ago4 0 CommentAir is not a single chemical element or compound, it is a mixture of gases, mainly nitrogen and oxygen but with numerous gases in small quantities.
