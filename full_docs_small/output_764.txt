Having a strong employer brand adds value to an employer's job offers and services to external candidates and clients. As such, the process of branding is largely concerned with establishing methods for attracting and retaining candidates and clients in order to augment a brand. These methods are then used to define how an employer goes about offering employment. A brand defines the external perceptions of an employer's ability to create a desirable workplace as well as respected products and services. These perceptions can be those of current, former and potential employees; clients, customers, and anyone somehow associated with the employer. The scope of a brand embodies every facet of the experience of employees and management practices; not simply an artificially constructed image. Given the ever increasing competition within the professional workplace, and the need for increased efficiency and productivity at the organizational level, branding has become progressively more vital for finding and keeping the best candidates for available jobs. Branding is about creating parallels between business plan and branding methodology in order to attract candidates that best serve a company's interests and who can help it grow. A brand is not a static concept, but a dynamic and segmented one. In order to attract and keep the best people for a variety of jobs, each subgroup of employees must be treated in a way specifically tailored for them. The employer brand is all about the employer-employee relationship. Naturally, businesses wish to channel the most resources to those segments driving the most profit. Once a business understands what these employees want from their employer, it can better understand which benefits packages and employee incentives will help retain current employees and attract potential employees best suited for each segment.Get new local jobs by emailEnter a keyword Enter your email Enter a passwordRELATED TOPICSBrand ManagementBrand management-the creation, development, monitoring and/or researching of the iconic symbols and designations for any given product, service or line-can take two forms.
