"Jeff Sessions’ Children: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know9.1K Views 1 Shares 16 CommentsBy Effie OrfanidesJan 10, 2017 at 9:22amJeff Sessions and his family at Christmas 2007. (Facebook/ Jeff Sessions)Former Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions is Donald Trump ‘s Attorney General. Sessions and his wife, Mary Blackshear Sessions, have three children; Mary Abigail Reinhardt, Ruth Sessions Walk, and Sam Sessions. The Sessions also have 10 grandchildren; Jane Ritchie, Alexa, Gracie, Sophia, Hannah, Joanna, Phoebe, Jim Beau, Lewis, and Nicholas.On February 8, the Senate confirmed Sessions as the new U.S. Attorney General. He has recused himself from all investigations related to Russia’s involvement in the 2016 presidential campaign due to his own role as an adviser for the Trump campaign.Here is what you need to know:1. Mary’s Husband Paul Is a Commanding Officer on the U.S.S. Alabama SubmarineMary Abigail Reinhardt is married to Paul Reinhardt, the Commanding Officer, Blue Crew of the U.S.S. Alabama submarine. He graduated from the University of Virginia in 1997 with a B.A. in Government and was commissioned through the Naval ROTC program.Paul became commanding officer in December 2014, taking over from Commander Brad Terry.“I know I have some big shoes to fill. We will continue to improve upon what you and the crew have already established,” Reinhardt said during the ceremony, AL.com reports. “I am truly humbled and honored to be your commanding officer. It is an awesome responsibility to be in command – especially on the finest submarine in the fleet – and one I do not take lightly.”The U.S.S. Alabama crew famously chants “Go ‘Bama, Rol Tide!” before boarding, which is why the University of Alabama donated 350 t-shirts to the submarine crew.“Both Alabama Blue and Gold crews sincerely appreciate The University of Alabama’s generosity and the continued support of our sailors, the Navy, and all of our men and women in uniform,” Reinhardt said at the December ceremony.“The t-shirts will be worn with pride. Roll Tide!”2. Mary’s Son Jim Beau Was Born with a Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia & His Left Lung Was Smaller Than it Should Have BeenJeff Sessions holds his granddaughter, Jane Ritchie Reinhardt, in 2008. (Facebook/ Jeff Sessions)In July 2011, the University of Florida Health Post reported that Mary and Paul’s son Jim Beau Reinhardt, was diagnosed with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia during the 34th week of gestation.When he was born, Jim Beau was missing half of his left diaphragm, forcing many of his vital organs to push his heart to the right side of his chest. That crowded his lungs, so his left lung is half the since it should be. His condition would have been a death sentence several years ago, but treatments have made it possible to overcome.Jim Beau was also born with tetralogy of Fallot, which allows blood with low oxygen levels to move throughout the body. Because of these two conditions, he had two major surgeries within a year of being born.“There are always some long-term health concerns with CDH babies, just in terms of their development,” Paul told UF Health. “He’s probably a little bit behind, but probably no different than any other CDH baby,” he added.3. Sam Sessions Followed His Father’s Footsteps Into Law & Is a Lawyer in BirminghamSam Sessions followed his father into law, attending the University of Alabama School of Law from 2007 to 2010.

According to AL.com, an MTV host by the name of Ira Madison III tweeted about the picture, questioning if Sessions was trying to prove that he wasn’t racist by holding his Asian-American granddaughter.“Sessions, sir, kindly return this Asian baby to the Toys R’ Us you stole her from … There is no reason for that child to be in his lap in a hearing other than to send an ‘I’m not racist message,'” Madison wrote in a series of since-deleted tweets.You can read Ruth’s letter about her dad below.“I am so honored to be my father’s daughter. His accomplishments and job titles aside, I am just so proud of his extreme graciousness towards those that intended him harm. They were relentless and ruthless, and Dad complained not. They spewed lies and hate, and Dad simply shrugged it off. They chose to attack him when he was not there to set the record straight. Yet, still, in his last chance to dish it right back at them, my Daddy simply wished his colleagues well and asked them to find hope (and progress) through reconciliation with those of the opposite view point. I obviously still have a lot to learn from my Dad,” Ruth said.Read More From HeavyJohn Kelly: 5 Fast Facts You Need to KnowRead More5 Fast Facts, Donald Trump, Jeff Sessions, Politics16 CommentsDiscuss on Facebook"
