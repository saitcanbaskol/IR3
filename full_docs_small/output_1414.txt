"Concrete Facts and Economic Strengths* Concrete is the second most consumed product on earth, behind water*. Yet by comparison, concrete construction represents millions of more jobs and a much greater economic return than water. In fact, sustainable water projects rely heavily on concrete for storage, distribution and reclamation. *There are nearly 3 tons of concrete produced each year for every human on the planet, making it the most used man-made product in the world. Concrete production and concrete construction have an impact on almost every facet of human existence. * Concrete usage is two-times more than wood, steel, plastic and aluminum combined. When you consider it, there are not many structures that donâ€™t include some type of cement-based building product. *Construction jobs in the US represent approximately 6% of employment or around 9,000,000 jobs**. Because concrete touches almost every aspect of construction, a large percentage of these jobs are supported by concrete. * The concrete supply chain reaches well beyond construction to include mining, equipment, transportation and industrial sectors of every economy. Both the world's strongest and weakest economies can benefit from a robust concrete construction supply chain.Finding ways to improve the quality of our concrete production system should be a focus of government, business and social stakeholders.
