"axesmCreate map axescollapse all in pageThe axesm function creates a map axes into which both  vector and raster geographic data can be projected using functions such as plotm and geoshow. Properties specific to map  axes can be assigned upon creation with axesm, and for an existing  map axes they can be queried and changed using getm and setm. Use the standard get and set methods to query and control the standard MATLAB ® axes properties of a map axes.Map axes are standard MATLAB axes with different default settings for some properties and a MATLAB structure for storing projection parameters and other data. The main  differences in default settings are:Axes properties XGrid, YGrid , XTick, YTick are set to 'off'.The hold mode is 'on'.The map projection structure stores the map axes properties, which, in addition to the  special standard axes settings, allow Mapping  Toolbox™ functions to recognize an axes or an opened FIG-file as a map axes. See Map Axes Properties for descriptions of the map axes properties.Syntaxaxesmaxesm (Name,Value)axesm (projid,Name,Value)Descriptionaxesm with no input arguments, initiates the axesmui map axes graphical user interface, which can be used  to set map axes properties. This is detailed on the axesmui reference page.axesm ( Name,Value) creates a map axes and  modifies the map axes appearance using name-value pairs to set properties. You can  specify multiple name-value pairs. Enclose each property name in quotes. For  example, 'FontSize',14 sets the font size for the map axes text.  Properties may be specified in any order, but the MapProjection property must be included. For a full list of properties, see Map Axes Properties.axesm ( projid, Name,Value) specifies which map projection to use. projid should match one of  the entries in the last column displayed by the maps function. You can also find these listed in Summary and Guide to Projections.ExamplesCreate Map Axes for Mercator ProjectionCreate map axes for a Mercator projection, with selected latitude limits:axesm ( 'MapProjection', 'mercator', 'MapLatLimit' , [-70 80])In the preceding example, all properties not explicitly addressed in the call are  set to either fixed or calculated defaults. The file mercator.m defines a projection function, so the same result could have been achieved with the  functionaxesm ( 'mercator', 'MapLatLimit' , [-70 80])Each projection function includes default values for all properties. Any following  property name/property value pairs are treated as overrides.In either of the above examples, data displayed in the given map axes is in a  Mercator projection. Any data falling outside the prescribed limits is not  displayed.Input Argumentscollapse allprojid — Map projection IDcharacter vector | string scalarMap projection ID, specified as a string scalar or character vector. projid should match one of the entries in the last  column displayed by the maps function. You can also  find these listed in Summary and Guide to Projections.NoteThe names of projection files are case sensitive. The projection  files included in Mapping  Toolbox software use only lowercase letters and Arabic  numerals.Example: 'eqdcylin'Name-Value Pair ArgumentsSpecify optional  comma-separated pairs of Name,Value arguments. Name is  the argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name must appear inside single quotes ( ' ' ). You can  specify several name and value pair arguments in any order as Name1,Value1,...,NameN,ValueN.Example: axesm ('MapProjection','pcarree','Frame','on') creates a  map axes with a Plate Carree projection, and makes the map frame  visible.NoteThe properties listed here are only a subset. For a full list, see Map Axes Properties.collapse all'MapProjection' — Map projectioncharacter vector | string scalarMap projection, specified as a string scalar or character vector. MapProjection sets the projection, and hence all  transformation calculations, for the map axes object. It must be a  member of the recognized projection set, which you can list by typing getm ('MapProjection') or maps .  For more information on projections, see the Mapping  Toolbox User's Guide. Some projections set their  own defaults for other properties, such as parallels and trim  limits.'MapLatLimit' — Geographic latitude limits of the display areatwo-element vectorGeographic latitude limits of the display area, specified as a  two-element vector of the form  [southern_limit  northern_limit]. This property can be set for many typical  projections and geometries, but cannot be used with oblique projections  or with globe, for example.When applicable, the MapLatLimit property may  affect the origin latitude if the Origin property is  not set explicitly when calling axesm. It may also  determine the value used for FLatLimit. See Access and Change Map Axes Properties for a more  complete description of the applicability of MapLatLimit and its interaction with the origin,  frame limits, and other properties.'MapLonLimit' — Geographic longitude limits of the display areatwo-element vectorGeographic longitude limits of the display area, specified as a  two-element vector of the form  [western_limit  eastern_limit]. This property can be set for many typical  projections and geometries, but cannot be used with oblique projections  or with globe, for example.When applicable, the MapLonLimit property may  affect the origin longitude if the Origin property is  not set explicitly when calling axesm. It may also  determine the value used for FLonLimit. See Access and Change Map Axes Properties for a more  complete description of the applicability of MapLonLimit and its interaction with the origin,  frame limits, and other properties.TipsIn general, after re-opening a saved figure that contains a map axes, you  should not attempt to modify the projection properties of that map axes.When you create a map axes with axesm and right click in  the axes, a context menu appears. If you do not need the menu or it interferes  with your application, you can disable it by resetting the 'ButtonDownFcn' property of the axes:ax = axesm ( 'mercator' ); % Right-clicking brings up context menu. set (ax, 'ButtonDownFcn' , []) % Context menu has been disabled.See AlsoPropertiesMap Axes PropertiesFunctionsaxes | gcm | getm | setmTopicsIntroduction to Mapping GraphicsThe Map AxesThe Map FrameMap Limit PropertiesThe Map GridIntroduced before R2006a"
