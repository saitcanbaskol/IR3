This field is actually the field AR_Balances.AvgDayToPay, and appears to be updated either when an invoice is closed for a customer, or when the AR integrity check is run ( Rebuild History from documents or Correct customer balances ).Documentation of the process shows two flaws from our perspective: -Partially paid but still open invoices are excluded - Dates originating from a small balance writeoff document are includedHas anyone out there customized the calculation of average days to pay to correct either of these issues? How did you do it?BTW: I hadn't caught that in our current version (V7.0 SP1) you can now set the Avg Days to pay data retention period. Don't know when that changed but it's a nice feature. Of course, you have to run an integrity check after changing the balance to get it update for the new retention period! The process to update Avg Days to Pay does NOT run as part of closing at this point so it appears that I need to automate that myself.Thanks in advance!Gail J-NReply"
