"Would YOU try 'carb cycling'? Only eating carbs on days you exercise can help you lose weight AND become more tonedJonny Rees is a personal trainer at Ultimate Performance Fitness, LondonSays people should only be eating carbohydrates on exercise daysThis means they will be stored in the muscles rather than the bellyEating low carb on the other days allows people to burn fat, he saysBy Madlen Davies for MailOnlinePublished: 02:36 EDT, 23 May 2016 | Updated: 09:49 EDT, 23 May 2016264shares104View commentsMany of us try to cut out carbs in an effort to slim down.But even the most mild-mannered of person can be transformed into a screaming wreck after a few days of the ensuing hunger.Instead of avoiding bread, pasta and rice, one personal trainer says a technique called 'carb cycling' can help us burn fat and gain muscle.Jonny Rees, a personal trainer at Ultimate Performance Fitness, London, explains carb cycling involves eating more carbohydrates on days when you exercise - and fewer on days of rest.+4Instead of avoiding bread, pasta and rice, a technique called 'carb cycling' can help people burn fat and gain muscle, according to Jonny Rees, a personal trainer at Ultimate Performance Fitness, LondonHe told MailOnline: 'It’s like a car. If you have your car and you have you’re going on a long drive from London to Scotland, you’d want a full tank of fuel.'That’s the same as a big day of exercise – you’d want a lot of carbs as fuel.'But if you leave the car in the driveway, you don’t need as much fuel. So if you’re not doing as much exercise, you don’t need as many carbs.'RELATED ARTICLESPrevious 1 NextLow fat diets are BAD for you: Stop counting calories and...

On days where they are resting they should avoid carbohydrates and eat more fat, says Mr ReesCarbs! The good, the bad, and the refinedLoaded Progress 0:00/0:00Too many carbohydrates can lead to fat being stored around the middle - increasing the chance of obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic disorder.So alternating days of high carb and low carb allows people to get all the benefits from carbohydrates and none of the drawbacks - as exercising means they won't be stored as a paunch.'To burn body fat you want insulin to be low (low carb), if you want to gain muscle you want insulin to be high (high carb),' Mr Rees said.Therefore, doing a mixture of both allows the body to remain lean without losing muscle mass.He continued: ''It’s not good to remove a major food group all the time.'Charlotte Crosby: 'My range is best because you can eat carbs'Loaded Progress 0:00/0:00+4The best types of fat to eat are avocado, nuts, oil fish like mackerel. 'Bad ' fats such as chocolate, usually come with carbohydratesCarbs help the muscles grow bigger because glycogen - the form of energy broken down from glucose - is stored in the muscles, he said.He added: 'It’s not just that you can do more exercise because carbs power your muscles – the carbs actually go into the muscles and make them bigger.'Working out how many carbohydrates to eat depends your their weight and exercise levels, Mr Rees said.But generally, after exercising people could eat around 30g of carbohydrates.This is the equivalent of one baked potato, three or four new potatoes, a palmful of pre-cooked rice, an apple and a banana, or a normal bowl of porridge.+4Carb cycling helps people burn fat while gaining muscle mass and becoming more toned, Mr Rees saidOn non-exercise days, the only carbs people should eat are those in vegetables - and as fruits contain a lot of sugar it's better to stick to berries, Mr Rees said.On these low-carb days it's important to eat more 'good' fats, such as oily fish, nuts and avocados.If you have your car and you have you’re going on a long drive from London to Scotland, you’d want a full tank of fuel. It's the same with carbsJonny Rees, personal trainer at Ultimate Performance Fitness, LondonHe says people get a feel for the lifestyle after a while and it becomes addictive.In his gym, people are usually put on a very low carb diet for 10 days to 2 weeks, and then he introduces carb cycling - an eating plan he says people can sustain long-term.The programme is as effective for women as men, although the results may be more obvious in men who naturally have more muscle mass, he said.And the results can be astounding, he added.'I’ve seen people do a boot camp plus carb cycling and lose up to 50kg [up to 7 st 12 lbs] - although they were overweight in the first place.'He said for the best results, people need to be doing intense exercise such as weight lifting or resistance training such as press-ups, sprints or intervals on the rower.'It’ll still work with more gentle exercise but the weight loss may not be quite as dramatic,' he added.Jonny Rees is a personal trainer at Ultimate Performance Fitness, London www.upfitness.co.ukA pre-marathon diet of ice cream, chocolate and browniesLoaded Progress 0:00/0:00AdvertisementShare or comment on this article264sharesProtester survives being turned into a human FIREBALL...
