Let's examine the different types of social interactions and test your knowledge with a quiz.Social InteractionErving Goffman was a sociologist who created a new field of study called microsociology, or social interaction. Social interaction is the process by which we act and react to those around us. In a nutshell, social interaction includes those acts people perform toward each other and the responses they give in return. Having a quick conversation with a friend seems relatively trivial.Goffman argued that these seemingly insignificant forms of social interaction are of major importance in sociology and should not be overlooked. Social interactions include a large number of behaviors, so many that in sociology, interaction is usually divided into five categories. These are: exchange, competition, cooperation, conflict and coercion. Let's examine these five types with a bit more detail.ExchangeExchange is the most basic type of social interaction. Whenever people interact in an effort to receive a reward or a return for their actions, an exchange has taken place. Exchange is a social process whereby social behavior is exchanged for some type of reward for equal or greater value. The reward can be material (a paycheck at a job) or nonmaterial (a 'thank you' from your coworker). Exchange theorists argue that behavior that is rewarded tends to be repeated; however, when the costs of an interaction outweigh the rewards, individuals are likely to end the relationship.CompetitionCompetition is a process by which two or more people attempt to achieve a goal that only one can attain. Competition is a common feature of Western societies and the cornerstone of the capitalist economic system and the democratic form of government. Most sociologists view competition as a positive thing - one that can motivate people to achieve goals. However, competition can also lead to psychological stress, a lack of cooperation in social relationships, inequality and even conflict.CooperationCooperation is the process in which people work together to achieve shared goals. Cooperation is a social process that gets things done; no group can complete its tasks or achieve its goals without cooperation from its members. Oftentimes, cooperation works together with other forms of interaction, such as competition. In a baseball game, for example, a team will work together (cooperation) while attempting to achieve a victory (a goal that only one team can attain).To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.
