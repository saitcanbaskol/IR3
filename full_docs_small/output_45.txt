Actually there are somethings in English which haven't yet been named explicitly rather are known genuinely by the names which are precisely different, derived from other contexts or scenarios and also the one which sounds like this perfectly relates to them however they are not the ones that we often understand when hear or see and so is the case with these words pride, sault and troop. They all are different as well as mean different but it's the context, characteristics and classes that make the words perfect to be used in other cases as well. So other words could also be sault, troop etc. Or simply we can use a phrase to mean them ie ""a company of lions"".
