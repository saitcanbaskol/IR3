It was introduced in North America for the 2002 model year as the Acura RSX  (the name changed from Integra due to Honda wanting customers to relate cars to the Acura brand, as opposed to nameplates like ""Integra"", ""Legend"". It does not stand for anything).In concordance with the introduction of the Integra's platform mate, the seventh-generation Civic being introduced in 2000, the Integra joined the Civic in abandoning Honda's traditional double-wishbone suspension at both ends and adopted MacPherson struts in the front and trailing arm type suspension in the rear along with the new K-series engine supplanting the B-series.The K-series engine features intelligent VTEC  (or i-VTEC), which electronically adjusts valve lift, valve duration and valve timing, giving the 2.0 L engine a flatter torque curve relative to previous VTEC implementations which only adjusted valve lift and valve duration.  [2]The Integra DC5 received a facelift in the 2005 model year. The headlight and taillight assemblies lost the so-called 'teardrop' shape. This made the assemblies flush with the bumpers.The RSX was marketed in April 2001 as a sports coupe.The curb weight of the car varies by equipment and year.USDM/CDM2002-2004 Acura RSX (MT/AT): 2,721 lb (1,234 kg) 2,789 lb (1,265 kg)2002-2004 Acura RSX Type-S: 2,778 lb (1,260 kg)2005-2006 Acura RSX (MT/AT): 2,734 lb (1,240 kg) 2,809 lb (1,274 kg)2005-2006 Acura RSX Type-S: 2,840 lb (1,288 kg)Japan2001-2004 Honda Integra iS (MT/AT): 2,579.4 lb (1,170 kg) 2,645.5 lb (1,200 kg) Note: Sunroof option adds 20kg.2001-2004 Honda Integra Type R: 2,579.4 lb (1,170 kg) Note: C package adds 10kg2004-2006 Honda Integra Type S (MT/AT): 2,645.5 lb (1,200 kg) 2,711.7 lb (1,230 kg) Note: Sunroof option adds 10kg.2004-2006 Honda Integra Type R: 2,601.4 lb (1,180 kg) Note: C package adds 10kgAustralia2002-2004 Honda Integra/Integra Luxury (MT/AT): 2,557 lb (1,160 kg) 2,623.5 lb (1,190 kg)2002-2004 Honda Integra Type R 2,557.3 lb (1,160 kg)2005-2006 Honda Integra Luxury (MT/AT): 2,601.4 lb (1,180 kg) 2,667.5 lb (1,210 kg)2005-2006 Honda Integra Type S: 2,711.6 lb (1,230 kg)New Zealand2002-2004 Honda Integra VTi (MT/AT): 2,623.5 lb (1,190 kg) 2,689.6 lb (1,220 kg)2002-2004 Honda Integra Type R 2,623.5 lb (1,190 kg)2005-2006 Honda Integra VTi (MT/AT): 2,623.5 lb (1,190 kg) 2,689.6 lb (1,220 kg)2005-2006 Honda Integra Type S: 2,711.6 lb (1,230 kg)Contents [ hide ]1 Market1.1 Japan1.2 Oceania2 Acura RSX2.1 US2.2 Canada2.3 Safety3 Performance4 Awards5 Racing6 Sales7 References8 External linksMarket  [ edit]Japan  [ edit]In Japan, the Integra was introduced in two versions, the Integra iS (later renamed Integra Type S in the 2004 refresh) and the Integra Type R. Integras produced from 07-2001 to 08-2004 were designated with LA-DC5 chassis code. Integras produced from 09-2004 until 07-2006 were ABA-DC5. JDM DC5s were the only Integras with two separate chassis codes. All other markets simply used DC5 in the VIN.The JDM iS/Type S (not to be confused with the RSX Type-S), which was essentially the same as the base Acura RSX, featured the K20A3 engine with an output of 160 hp (120 kW) and is offered with either a 5-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. Integra iS is offered in 2002-2004 model years with 15-inch steel wheels with covers, or optional 16-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels. JDM Type S was offered in 2005-2006 model years, and was equipped with a 17-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels shared with the Acura RSX Type-S. The Integra Type R, sold in Japan had reduced weight, a 220 PS / 164 kW / 217 hp K20A I4 engine (Japan-only; Oceania models have an engine similar to the Acura RSX-S), 6-speed close-ratio manual transmission, as well as a helical limited slip differential  (LSD), stiffer springs and shocks, high intensity discharge projector headlights, aluminum pedal set, 4-piston front Brembo brake caliper, 17-inch 5 double spoke wheels on Bridgestone Potenza tires, Recaro suede seats/matching interior, leather wrapped MOMO steering wheel, body trim, front strut bar, and more. The Type R lacked many of the luxury features (like vanity mirrors or side airbags) in the Type S, true to its racing heritage. The C package on the Type R added various accessories like the rear window wiper, remote control, folding mirrors.  [3] JDM Integras iS had one interior colour, Ebony, available for the first model year. After 2002, Titanium interiors became available for all exterior colours. Type S had redesigned cloth and leather seats. Type R had choices of black/blue/red interiors (including colour matching Recaro seats), depending on exterior colours. Refreshed Integra Type R had the option of either the high wing, or the trunk lip spoiler. Integra iS and Type S were available with sunroof, automatic air conditioner, side SRS airbag, and navigation systems.  [4] Additional interior and exterior accessories were available from Honda's Modulo line. Modulo accessories offered include interior trim (shift knobs, decals, etc.), foglights, aero kits (front/side/rear bumper enhancements), wing spoilers, alloy wheels, push button start, upgraded speakers, and navigation.Exterior Color Interior Color iS Type STaffetta White Ebony/Titanium XPremium White Pearl Ebony/Titanium XAlabaster Silver Metallic Ebony/Titanium XSatin Silver Metallic Ebony/Titanium XMagnesium Metallic Ebony/Titanium XDesert Silver Metallic Ebony/Titanium XJade Green Metallic Ebony/Titanium XEternal Blue Pearl Ebony/Titanium XVivid Blue Pearl Ebony/Titanium XNighthawk Black Pearl Ebony/Titanium X XMilano Red Ebony/Titanium X XBlaze Orange Metallic Ebony/Titanium XExterior Color Interior Color Type RChampionship White Black RedMilano Red Black RedSatin Silver Metallic (02-04) Black RedAlabaster Silver Metallic (05-06) Black RedNighthawk Black Pearl Black RedEternal Blue Pearl (02-04) Black BlueVivid Blue Pearl (05-06) Black BlueHID head lights/Modulo front kitModulo side skirtWith Modulo rear kitBrembo quad piston calipers, 17x7 5 dual spoke wheelsMain engine compartment. K20A engineRed RecarosOceania  [ edit]Australia had four models of the Integra. They were simply named Integra, Integra Luxury, Integra Type R and Integra Type S. The base Integra was simply the JDM Integra iS, while the Luxury added accessories like leather seats, sunroof, and side driver/passenger airbags. Australian Type Rs did not have full JDM specifications, they lacked the Brembo braking system, K20A 220PS engine (instead it has 200 hp K20A2), and the 17-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels (Regular 16-inch 5-spokes were mounted, painted in gun metal or white). However, the Australian Type R does still retain the JDM's helical limited slip differential, and full Type R interior (MOMO steering wheel, aluminum pedals+shift knob, Recaro seats and colour matched carpets)/aero (wing/front/rear bumper lips). The Honda Integra Type R was dropped in 2004, and was replaced by the Integra Type S. The Type S was mechanically identical to the USDM Acura RSX Type-S (though it did lack cruise control), but badged like the JDM Type S. When the Integra was refreshed in 2005, Integra base model was dropped. The only trims available in 2006 was Integra Luxury and Type S.  [5] Black interior was the only colour available for the redesign.Exterior Color Integra Integra Luxury Type R (02-04) Type S (05-06)Championship White N/A N/A Black/Red N/APremium White Pearl Black Black N/A BlackMilano Red Black Black Black BlackSatin Silver Metallic Black Black Black N/ANighthawk Black Pearl Black Black Black/Red BlackArctic Blue Pearl N/A N/A Black/Blue N/AEternal Blue Pearl Black Black N/A N/AVivid Blue Pearl (05-06) N/A Black N/A BlackMagnesium Metallic (05-06) N/A Black N/A BlackBlaze Orange Metallic (05-06) N/A Black N/A BlackNew Zealand only had two models, the Integra VTi and Type R. Integra VTi came with alloy wheels as standard, but was otherwise the same as JDM Integra iS. Type R was also replaced by the Type-S like Australia in 2004.

The RSX had numerous standard features such as cruise control, 4-wheel ABS, power windows and a power moonroof. The RSX used the 160 hp (120 kW) K20A3 engine throughout the entire production run. (Engine was rated 155 hp (116 kW) after SAE net revision)  [6] Sport cloth seats were standard with optional perforated leather interior. An optional 16-inch 7-spoke alloy wheel was available that is very similar to the USDM 15-inch DC2 Integra Type R alloy wheels. The RSX was available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed automatic with Sequential SportShift and Grade Logic Control.The RSX Type-S had a 200 hp (150 kW) (2002–2004) K20A2 or 210 hp (160 kW) K20Z1  [7]  [8]  (Labeled in 2006 as 201 hp due to SAE hp calculation revision)  [6] in 2005-2006 and a close-ratio 6-speed manual transmission. An automatic transmission was not offered on the Type-S. The Type-S included additional features such as sport-tuned suspension, gunmetal painted wheels, 11.8"" ventilated front disc brakes, larger sway bars and a Bose 7-speaker (including a subwoofer mounted on the spare tire) audio system.  [9]One peculiar note for the initial 2002 model year were two available options. HID projector headlights from the Integra Type R was made available to the RSX for $1500.  [10]In 2005, the RSX received a refresh. On the exterior, Acura updated the headlights and taillights and the Type-S received an updated rear hatch spoiler. The base model received a 12 spoke Enkei alloy wheel, while the Type-S came with 17-inch 5-spoke Enkei/Asahi wheels wrapped in Michelin HX MXM4 215/45/R17 tires.  [8] 17-inch Enkei J10s alloy wheels (with Acura specific fitment and center caps) were optional. Under the hood, the RSX Type-S received the camshafts, b-pipe and muffler, 4.77 final drive ratio, crankshaft pulley and the intake snorkel duct from the Japanese DC5 Type R.The ""A-Spec Performance Package"" was a dealer option package. The body kit is essentially debadged JDM Honda Modulo kit, while the wing is from the Type R. The package included a sport suspension system, under-body spoiler kit, wing spoiler (came with stronger hatch shocks to hold additional weight), exterior badging and 5 dual spoke 17-inch gun metal wheels.  [11]  [12]The RSX had numerous exterior color options but only two interior colors: Black (Ebony) and Beige (Titanium). The exterior color choice would dictate the interior color. Some colors were available in either trim package while other colors would be available in one trim level but not the other.In 2002, colour options were as follows:  [13]Exterior Color Interior Color Base Type-STaffetta White Titanium XPremium White Pearl Titanium XNoble Green Tricoat (2002 only) Optional Never orderedSatin Silver Metallic Ebony X XDesert Silver Metallic Ebony X XJade Green Metallic Titanium X XArctic Blue Pearl Ebony XEternal Blue Pearl Ebony XNighthawk Black Pearl Ebony X XFirepepper Red (2002 only) Titanium X XMilano Red Titanium X XRedondo Red Pearl (2003 only) Titanium X XIn 2006, the available color combinations were as follows:  [14]Exterior Color Interior Color Base Type-STaffetta White Titanium XPremium White Pearl Titanium XAlabaster Silver Metallic Ebony X XMagnesium Metallic Ebony/Titanium X XJade Green Metallic Titanium X XVivid Blue Pearl Ebony X XNighthawk Black Pearl Ebony X XMilano Red Titanium X XRedondo Red Metallic Titanium X XBlaze Orange Metallic Ebony XCanada  [ edit]Three models were available in Canada: Base (cloth interior, no ABS, no moonroof, no cruise control, unpainted foglight cover, unpainted side skirt, 15-inch steel wheels with wheel covers, essentially an Integra iS.), Premium (Moonroof, 16-inch alloy wheels, heated seats) and Type-S. The A-Spec package was available to the Type-S models. Canadian RSX had a significantly larger washer sprayer bottle to deal with harsher weather. They were 4.5 litres vs. 2.5 litres for USDM cars.The refreshed in 2005 brought the same update as USDM cars. Base model now has standard alloy wheels (16 inch, 12 spoke). Sport cloth standard in 2005, optional leather in 2005-2006.Wheel types varied according to model year. 2002-2004 models had a 15-inch steel wheel with covers (Base), 16-inch 5-spoke alloy wheel in silver (Premium) or gunmetal (Type-S). 2005-2006 had 12 spoke wheels for both Base and Premium.
