"Infarction is a medical condition in which tissue dies because the arterial blood supply is blocked. It is usually the end product of ischemia, or lowered blood supply. Infarction is most often seen with the word ""myocardial,"" indicating a heart attack. This condition occurs when one of the main cardiac arteries is blocked. When this happens, a person will often need heart bypass surgery.Some symptoms of myocardial infarction include chest pain, pain in the left arm or jaw, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. However, about 25 percent of people who have a heart attack will not have symptoms. This is most common in the elderly and in diabetics.A stroke, or cerebrovascular accident, is usually caused by an infarction. It may be caused by a blood vessel with inadequate blood flow due to plaque build-up, or by a small blood clot or bit of plaque from another artery that interrupts the brain's blood supply. Some 80 percent of strokes are caused by this condition.Peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) can also be related to myocaridal infarction. In PAOD, the arteries in the legs become occluded and the blood flow is insufficient to maintain healthy circulation. Some people, especially diabetics, may undergo amputations due to gangrene in the lower extremities.AdThe main treatment for the condition, regardless of where it occurs, is to get the blood flowing again. This can be done in a variety of ways. If the patient is a smoker, he is strongly urged to quit. The doctor may also have the patient increase his activity level and lose weight. A physician may also prescribe blood thinning medicine to help prevent clots from forming elsewhere.As with many disorders, the best way to treat this problem is to prevent it. Quitting smoking, losing weight, exercising and controlling blood sugar are all effective ways to help reduce the chances of developing the ischemia that leads to infarction. With ischemia and infarction, the old adage, ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,"" is all too true.AdYou might also LikeRecommendedRelated wiseGEEK ArticlesWhat Is a Splenic Infarction?What is Brain Ischemia?What is an Inferior Myocardial Infarction?What is the Most Common Myocardial Infarction Pathophysiology?What is a Brain Infarction?What is a Vena Cava Filter?What is Cerebrovascular Disease?AdDiscuss this Articlegolf07Post 5My dad has had more than one stroke and each time they have called these an acute infarction. His first stroke was minor and he had a full recovery.With his most recent stroke, it was much more severe and now he is paralyzed on his left side. This infarction also affected his speech and thought process.You can tell that he wants to communicate something, but he has a hard time doing it. One of the worst things about something like this, is you don't usually have any warning this is going to happen.Being able to receive medical treatment as soon as possible is a plus, but many times a lot of damage has already been done.sunshinedPost 4I happened to be with my grandpa when he had a coronary infarction. We were eating lunch and he just slumped over in his chair. We immediately called for help and he was taken to the hospital.He did not have any history of heart problems, so this was a surprise for everybody. Not everyone survives a heart attack, so we were so thankful that he made it to the hospital alive.Most of his arteries were blocked and he had open heart surgery that same week. I have heard about other situations where someone doesn't have any symptoms before they have a heart attack, but this was the only time I have personally seen it happen, and hope I never have to go through that again.anon147828Post 3My name is c arroyo i have infarction cerebellar. what is to happen to me? can anyone tell me please?Related Topics Myocardial Infarct Acute Infarction Infarction Myocardial InfarctionCoronary Infarctionkitty46Post 2My grandson was born with a cerebral infarct on the brain.
