You will be able to see per-article earnings in your Payment History section.Will revenue-share assignments really earn more for me than flat fee assignments?There is no guarantee that a revenue-share article will earn more than a flat-fee payment. However, we specifically choose the assignments that we believe will generate the most revenue and make those available for revenue share, thereby maximizing your chances of earning more than a flat fee would earn you over time.Can I choose the payment type for assignments I claim?No, the payment type for each assignment is pre-determined. A flat-fee assignment is only available for a flat fee, and a revenue-share assignment is only available for revenue share.How often is the payout for revenue-share assignments?Payments will be made on revenue-share earnings once a month, provided an overall $10 minimum is met. For instance, if the total earnings for all of your revenue-share articles are $16 for that month, you will be paid $16 that month.If your earnings are less than $10, the earnings will carry over into the next month. For instance, if your total revenue-share earnings are $9.50 in a given month, $9.50 will be added to your total for the next month. If that total is more than $10, you will be paid that month.How soon will I get paid after I submit each article?All payments for work displayed on your Payment History page during that month will be deposited into your personal PayPal account before the end of the following month.

We have selected only the titles that we think will generate more traffic (and therefore more revenue) for revenue share.How can I increase my earnings?Typically, the more useful your article is to the reader, the more you will earn. For instance, adding photos helps. We have also posted tips for socializing your articles here.Do writers who do more work for studioD earn a higher revenue share?No, there is no tier system in place at this time.Do revenue-share assignments count against my assignment limit when claimed?Yes, revenue share articles are treated like any other article and count against your assignment limit.FilmmakerWhat is the studioD Filmmaker Program?The studioD Filmmaker Program is a program that allows independent video producers to make money producing instructional and informational content for eHow, LIVE STRONG .COM and other Demand Media properties. Not only will you be making money and gaining worldwide exposure for your videos, but you will be helping millions of visitors answer their ""how-to"" questions.How do I earn money with the studioD Filmmaker Program?It's simple.Claim a Project - The Find Projects tab has pre-built projects, ranging in price from $200 - $600. The project comes with talent attached…..all you have to do is search for available projects in your general area.Produce the Project - Once you have claimed the project, you'll have 2 weeks to schedule with the talent, produce and edit the project. You'll have a general set of studioD Production Guidelines to assist you, and in some cases you'll have production requirements for the specific project you are producing.Send in the Project and Get Paid - When the project is completed, you will upload high-resolution videos to us along with any necessary release forms. Once your project is accepted, you will receive your payment within a week via PayPal.What is an example of a studioD project?A studioD project is a collection of up to 30 videos within a specific category that a filmmaker may produce with a single Talent in a single Location. Each title will have one of five production formats associated with it. The specific requirements of each video will be determined by the format, but all individual videos within a Project are generally required to be 1-3 minutes in length and answer one specific how to question. For example, a project on ""Fractions in Mathematics"" may include video titles such as ""How to add unlike fractions"" and ""How to multiply fractions."" If you do not complete all of the titles within a project, your final payment will be pro-rated based on the number of titles completed.How do I check out a project?Projects created by studioD will be under the Find Projects tab. These projects will consist of up to 30 individual titles and come with pre-determined Production Guidelines. Guidelines will vary depending on what site you are shooting for.How much do I get paid per project?On average, you can expect to receive $200-$600 per project. The payment amount is based on the number of 1-3 minute videos created, and the price of each video. The price of each video is determined by the format, and is variable depending on difficulty. A video requiring a single static interview shot might be paid at $15, where a demonstration requiring more edits would be paid at $20. The format and resulting price will be displayed when you claim a project.Is there a limit to how many projects I can claim?We have a 30 clip limit for new filmmakers to ensure that all content abides by our guidelines, and proper feedback is granted regarding the work. After a few projects have been reviewed you will be eligible for an increase in the amount of work that you can check out at one time.Do I need a whole crew to shoot a studioD Project?studioD projects are designed to be completed by a single filmmaker, in a single location, with a single Talent, in a single day. The payment is the same regardless of how many people contribute to the production, so you'll make more money if you shoot solo.How long does it take to complete a studioD project?It depends on the complexity and number of titles, but you can expect for an average 15 video studioD project to take anywhere from 4-6 hours to shoot and edit once you have a few under your belt.

In addition, they may appear on the YouTube channels associated with our Demand Media properties.What are the minimum equipment requirements to produce video for studioD?First and foremost, you need a professional level High Definition or HDV camera that shoots at a minimum resolution of 720p or 1080i. We require our filmmakers to have an HD camera model with large image sensors (no CCD cameras), 1 dedicated audio recording device with manual recording controls, a small lighting package, tripod, and NLE editing software.

Each video you produce will have an associated format detailing the specific content requirements and many of these will include multiple camera angles and b-roll footage. You can read the complete Production Guidelines in the Filmmaker Resource Center section of the site and learn about additional technical and editorial requirements.Am I responsible for finding the Talent to appear on camera?No. The project will come attached with a talent who resides in your area. All you will have to do is claim the project and schedule the shoot. If you have someone else in mind that you would like to shoot with, please have them apply as on-screen talent through our Talent & Expert Network. If approved, you will be able to use this person in your videos. By participating in your videos, the Talent will receive free promotion on the Demand Media network of sites.What makes a good shooting location?For the majority of our content we prefer that you avoid using a studio setting, opting instead for a location that suits your talent and the subject well. A good location will be a quiet, controlled place that is pleasing to the eye. For example, if you are shooting a series on Education, try to use an actual school or classroom for the project. If you are shooting Soccer, find a real soccer field that looks nice.I am an expert on something, can I film myself?No. studioD will not approve Projects for production where the filmmaker is the Talent.What release forms do you require me to submit?We require that you upload signed and dated copies of the following forms with your Project. Both release forms are also available as an online form that can be digitally signed. You will be able to find copies of these documents and instructions on obtaining digital signatures in the Resource Center.Appearance Release - This must be signed by all parties that appear in your videos. If minors appear, the legal guardian must also sign the release. Your Talent will not need to sign the Appearance Release, as they have already signed the contributor’s agreement in the studio.Location Release - This must be filled out by the location that you film at. It is generally not required for public locations, but when in doubt, get it signed. Residential properties do require location releases.What if my Talent or Location refuses to sign the release forms?We will not be able to accept projects without the completed set of release forms. Make sure that you get everyone to read the releases BEFORE you begin filming your videos.Can studioD choose to reject my project?Yes.
